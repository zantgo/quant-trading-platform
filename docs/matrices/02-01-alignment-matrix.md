# Alignment Matrix Specification

**Version:** 11.6 (2026-09-16) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.
**Status:** Approved
**Engine:** Market Monitoring Engine (MME)
**Producing Layer:** Layer 2 — Alignment Layer
**Purpose:** This document defines the physical schema, computation contract, and 10-dimensional agreement model of the **Alignment Matrix** — the multi-timeframe consensus object. It measures whether independent Metrics Matrices for the same symbol, computed at different temporal resolutions, describe the *same* market condition.

---

## 1. Conceptual Definition

The Alignment Matrix answers a single question: **Do multiple timeframes of the same entity agree?**

Where the [Metrics Matrix](02-07-metrics-matrix.md) measures *local confluence* (agreement among indicators within one timeframe), the Alignment Matrix measures *cross-timeframe agreement* (agreement among timeframes). It consumes a set of Metrics Matrices — one per timeframe for a single symbol — and produces a unified consensus object.

```
[Metrics Matrix: micro 60s ]─┐
[Metrics Matrix: fast  180s]─┤
[Metrics Matrix: slow  300s]─┼──► ALIGNMENT LAYER (L2) ──► [Alignment Matrix]
[Metrics Matrix: macro 900s]─┘         (10 dimensions)
```

The Alignment Matrix is implemented as `AlignmentMatrix` (`crates/core-domain/src/alignment.rs`), produced by `compute_alignment()`.

## 3. The 10 Alignment Dimensions

The `dimensions` array is ordered. Each index maps to a specific agreement axis:

| # | Dimension | Measures | Computation Basis |
|---|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| 0 | **Trend** | Directional trend agreement | Weighted mean of per-TF `MarketContext.trend.score`, mapped signed→`[0,100]`. |
| 1 | **Momentum** | Momentum-vector agreement | Weighted mean of per-TF momentum scores. |
| 2 | **Volume** | Participation agreement | Weighted mean of per-TF volume scores. |
| 3 | **Volatility** | Volatility-regime agreement | Weighted mean of per-TF volatility scores. |
| 4 | **Structure** | S/R role agreement | % of TFs whose support/resistance label agrees. |
| 5 | **Signal** | Cross-TF signal confluence | % of signals appearing in ≥2 TFs. |
| 6 | **Regime** | Regime-classification agreement | % of TFs sharing the dominant regime. |
| 7 | **Confidence** | Confidence consistency | `100 − sqrt(population_variance(per_tf_confidence_scores))` — the population variance uses a `÷ N` denominator. For N < 2 timeframes the score is hardcoded `50.0` (no variance can be computed; the legacy Bessel `N − 1` sample variance and mean-confidence fallback are not used). |
| 8 | **Liquidity** | RVOL consistency | `(1 − coefficient_of_variation)` of RVOL across TFs. |
| 9 | **Tradability** | Cross-timeframe tradability agreement | % of TFs with non-neutral bias and non-compressed regime. *(Renamed from "Opportunity" in the institutional redesign — the L4 Opportunity Matrix is the canonical owner of opportunity concepts; this dimension measures TFs agreeing on whether conditions are tradable.)* |

### 3.1 AlignState Derivation

The `AlignState` enum has **seven** wire values: `StrongBullish` | `Bullish` | `Bearish` | `StrongBearish` | `Neutral` | `Mixed` | `NoData` (serialized PascalCase; the `Display` impl renders `STRONG_BULLISH` / `BULLISH` / `BEARISH` / `STRONG_BEARISH` / `NEUTRAL` / `MIXED` / `NO_DATA` for human-facing surfaces). The legacy `ALIGNED` / `PARTIAL` / `DIVERGENT` and 4-state `BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL/MIXED` vocabularies are retired.

**Signed dimensions** (Trend, Momentum, Volume, Volatility) — derived from the signed weighted mean `m ∈ [-1, 1]` (`AlignmentDimension::from_signed`):

- `score = (m + 1) / 2 × 100` (magnitude of the net signed mean, mapped to `[0, 100]`).
- `confidence = |m| × 100`.
- State from the signed mean `m` (first match wins):
  - `m > +0.6` → `StrongBullish`
  - `m > +0.3` → `Bullish`
  - `m < -0.6` → `StrongBearish`
  - `m < -0.3` → `Bearish`
  - else → `Neutral`

**Unsigned dimensions** (Structure, Signal, Regime, Confidence, Liquidity, Tradability) — derived from a `[0, 100]` score via `AlignmentDimension::new` (state is bucketed from the same 0-100 score; `confidence = score` because `new` sets `confidence = score / 100 × 100`):

- `score == 0` → `NoData`
- `score ≥ 80` → `StrongBullish`
- `score ≥ 60` → `Bullish`
- `score > 40` (i.e. `40 < score < 60`) → `Neutral`
- `score > 20` (i.e. `20 < score ≤ 40`) → `Bearish`
- `score ≤ 20` (non-zero) → `StrongBearish`
- `Mixed` is a declared variant but is **not reachable** under the current 0-100 mapping (the branch above 60 and below 60 never overlap); it remains reserved in the vocabulary.

> **Wire-casing note.** The JSON values on the wire are PascalCase (`"StrongBullish"`, `"NoData"`, …). The SCREAMING_SNAKE form appears only in the Rust `Display` impl used for human-facing labels, never in serde output.

## 4. Computation Contract

### 4.1 Timeframe Weighting

Each contributing timeframe is weighted by its duration, favouring higher timeframes:

$$w_{tf} = \text{clamp}\left(\frac{\text{duration\_seconds}}{\text{divisor}},\ 0.2,\ 1.0\right)$$

The divisor is the **slowest active** slot's duration (see [Timeframe Model §4](../conceptual-foundations/01-04-timeframe-model.md)). The slowest slot always weights `1.0`; shorter slots scale down proportionally. With the full active count (v11.2 `active_timeframes = 10` — every slot of the fixed pool running) the slowest slot is `longterm2` (3600 s), so `divisor = 3600 s` and the proportional fallback's clamp floor (0.2) leaves `micro1`…`macro2` (1–300 s) at the 0.20 floor and `longterm1` at 0.25; at smaller active counts the divisor is the slowest ACTIVE slot (see [Timeframe Model §4](../conceptual-foundations/01-04-timeframe-model.md)).

**Divisor rule:** `divisor = max({duration_seconds for slot in active_slots})`. On the fixed ladder with every slot ACTIVE (`active_timeframes = 10`): `divisor = 3600 s`; the default count (5) resolves it to `slow1` (30 s).

The weighted consensus for a dimension is:

$$\text{mtf\_alignment} = \text{clamp}\left(\frac{\sum_{tf} \text{score}_{tf} \cdot w_{tf}}{\sum_{tf} w_{tf}},\ -1,\ 1\right)$$

### 4.2 Overall Blend

The four signed consensus scores are blended with fixed weights:

$$\text{mtf\_overall\_score} = \text{clamp}\big((0.5\,T + 0.3\,M + 0.1\,V_{t} + 0.1\,V_{m}) \times 100,\ -100,\ 100\big)$$

where `T` = `mtf_trend_alignment`, `M` = `mtf_momentum_alignment`, `V_t` = `mtf_volatility_alignment`, `V_m` = `mtf_volume_alignment`.

> **Thin-participation reweight (v6.10.16, FIX-H2).** When the volume dimension reads THIN/VERY_THIN (`dimensions[2].score < 25`) the blend switches to `0.55·T + 0.35·M + 0.05·V_t + 0.05·V_m` — the low-participation volume read is a participation qualifier, not a directional signal, so it can no longer veto four aligned timeframes into NEUTRAL. The **effective weights ride on the wire** (`blend_weights: [["Trend", 0.55], ["Momentum", 0.35], ["Volume", 0.05], ["Volatility", 0.05]]` — the keys are the **full dimension names**, never the `"T"` / `"Vt"` / `"Vm"` abbreviations, which mislabeled Volume/Volatility swapped vs. the spec) and the Alignment export's `score_calculation` block mirrors them exactly (v6.10.19d A: the on-screen formula line and the export `formula` field were removed — the weight chips are the display). Standard weights (`[["Trend", 0.5], ["Momentum", 0.3], ["Volume", 0.1], ["Volatility", 0.1]]`) are the default; the reweight only applies in the thin regime. (The L3 grace band in [02-02 §3.1](./02-02-analysis-matrix.md) is the margin policy for the residual band; this reweight is the structural fix below it.)

### 4.3 Trend Agreement Percentage

$$\text{trend\_agreement\_pct} = \frac{\max(\text{positive\_tf\_count}, \text{negative\_tf\_count})}{\text{total\_tf}} \times 100$$

### 4.4 Cross-Timeframe Signal Count

When ≥2 timeframes are present:

```
signal_cross_tf_count = number of DISTINCT (indicator, label, kind) signal
                        identities active on ≥2 timeframes
```

Implemented in `crates/core-domain/src/alignment.rs` (`cross_tf_count`). The value
is the honest cross-TF agreement count — a signal identity shared by two or more
timeframes — **not** `round(0.30 × total signals)`. (AUDIT-H1, v6.10.16: the old
`0.3 × total` heuristic saturated the signal-alignment dimension at 100% with
≥13 total signals and made every downstream `≥ 3` gate trivially true; the
dimension formula `cross_tf / tf_count × 100` is unchanged — only its input is
honest now.) Consumers should treat it as a cross-TF agreement count: gates
like `signal_cross_tf_count ≥ 3` (`02-02-analysis-matrix.md`) fire only when
three distinct signal identities are genuinely shared across timeframes.

### 4.5 Overall Label

```
score ≥  40 → STRONG_BULL_MTF
score ≥  20 → WEAK_BULL_MTF
score ≤ -40 → STRONG_BEAR_MTF
score ≤ -20 → WEAK_BEAR_MTF
otherwise   → NEUTRAL_MTF
```

> **Band alignment (v6.10.13, M-1).** The strong band uses ±40 to match the canonical L3 `MarketBias` thresholds (`derive_analysis`: `> 40 → StrongBullish`). The legacy ±60 strong band rendered the same `mtf_overall_score` (e.g. 45) as "WEAK BULL" on the Alignment header while the Analysis header said "STRONG BULLISH".

## 5. Empty / Degenerate States

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| No timeframes supplied | `AlignmentMatrix::empty()` → `timeframes_present = 0`, `mtf_overall_label = "NO_DATA"`, 10 zero-score dimensions. |
| Single timeframe | Dimensions still computed but agreement percentages reflect a single data point; the Confidence (dim 7) and Liquidity (dim 8) dimensions hardcode `score = 50.0` when `N < 2` (§3). |
| Missing indicator (e.g. no S/R) | The affected dimension degrades to score `0` rather than failing. |

> `AlignState` values on the wire are PascalCase (`"Bullish"`, `"Neutral"`, `"StrongBullish"`, …) — see §3.1 for the state mapping. Dimensions 2 and 3 carry the recomputed §6.1 scores (volume `mean = 0.10` → score 55.0 / confidence 10.0; volatility `mean = 0.20` → score 60.0 / confidence 20.0).

### 6.1 Worked per-TF decomposition (Volume & Volatility)

The Volume (55.0) and Volatility (60.0) dimension scores above decompose into per-slot signed scores as follows (weights per §4.1 on the fixed 10-slot ladder — `micro1`…`macro2` 0.2 (clamp floor), `longterm1` 0.25, `longterm2` 1.0; Σw = 2.85):

| Slot | Weight `w` | Volume `s` | Volatility `s` |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| MICRO1 | 0.2 | +0.10 | +0.30 |
| MICRO2 | 0.2 | +0.10 | +0.30 |
| FAST1 | 0.2 | +0.10 | +0.15 |
| FAST2 | 0.2 | +0.10 | +0.15 |
| SLOW1 | 0.2 | +0.10 | +0.15 |
| SLOW2 | 0.2 | +0.10 | +0.15 |
| MACRO1 | 0.2 | +0.10 | +0.15 |
| MACRO2 | 0.2 | +0.10 | 0.00 |
| LONGTERM1 | 0.25 | +0.30 | +0.40 |
| LONGTERM2 | 1.0 | +0.05 | +0.20 |

- **Signed mean** `m = Σ w·s / Σw` (direction, §3.1): Volume `(0.2·0.80 + 0.25·0.30 + 1.0·0.05) / 2.85 = (0.160 + 0.075 + 0.050) / 2.85 = 0.285 / 2.85 = 0.10` → `mtf_volume_alignment = 0.10`; Volatility `(0.2·1.35 + 0.25·0.40 + 1.0·0.20) / 2.85 = (0.270 + 0.100 + 0.200) / 2.85 = 0.570 / 2.85 = 0.20` → `mtf_volatility_alignment = 0.20`. Both `|m| ≤ 0.3` → `Neutral`.
- **Score & confidence** (§3.1 `from_signed`): `score = (m + 1) / 2 × 100`, `confidence = |m| × 100`. Volume → `(0.10 + 1) / 2 × 100 = 55.0`, confidence `10.0`; Volatility → `(0.20 + 1) / 2 × 100 = 60.0`, confidence `20.0`. Both states are `Neutral` (neither mean crosses `±0.3`).

> **Rounding note.** Per-TF values are rounded to 2 dp; weighted aggregates are computed from the unrounded values. Multiple valid per-TF decompositions exist; this one satisfies `m = 0.10` / `0.20` simultaneously. The legacy sign-agreement decomposition (`score = a × 100` → 72.0 / 75.0) does **not** match the code — `from_signed` derives the score from the signed mean, not from the majority-sign share.

## 7. Lifecycle & Guarantees

| Property | Guarantee |
|----------|-----------|
| **Determinism** | Identical per-TF Metrics Matrices produce an identical Alignment Matrix. |
| **Dimensional invariant** | `dimensions.len()` is **always** 10, even in the empty state. |
| **Bounded scores** | All dimension scores clamp to `[0, 100]`; MTF blends clamp to `[-100, 100]`. |
| **Upstream isolation** | The Alignment Matrix reads only completed Metrics Matrices; it never triggers indicator recomputation. |
