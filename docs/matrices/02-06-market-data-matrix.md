# Market Data Matrix Specification

**Version:** 11.10 (2026-09-17) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.
**Status:** Approved
**Engine:** Data Infrastructure Engine (DIE)
**Producing Layer:** Layer 2 — Market Data Layer
**Purpose:** This document defines the physical schema of the **Market Data Matrix** — the uniform, multi-timeframe OHLCV candle stream that is the primary input to the Market Monitoring Engine.

---

## 1. Conceptual Definition

The Market Data Matrix transforms the raw `NormalizedEvent` stream into standardized temporal boundaries. Trade events are aggregated into OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) candles across configurable timeframes. This is the **sole data contract** between the DIE and the MME.

```

```

## 2. Physical Schema

A single `NormalizedCandle` represents one completed candle for one symbol at one timeframe:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `exchange` | `string` | Originating venue. |
| `symbol` | `string` | Unified internal symbol (e.g., `BTC-USDT`). |
| `timeframe_secs` | `u64` | Candle duration in seconds (60 / 180 / 300 / 900). |
| `timestamp` | `u64` | Candle close time (Unix epoch, milliseconds). |
| `open` | `Decimal` | First trade price in the interval. |
| `high` | `Decimal` | Highest trade price in the interval. |
| `low` | `Decimal` | Lowest trade price in the interval. |
| `close` | `Decimal` | Last trade price in the interval. |
| `volume` | `Decimal` | Total base-asset volume traded. |
| `trades_count` | `u64` | Number of trades aggregated. |
| `reconstructed` | `Option<ReconstructionMethod>` | Provenance flag — `Some(ExchangeHistorical)` / `Some(ExponentialMovingAverage)` / `Some(LinearExtrapolation)` for candles filled by the reconstruction engine (see [08-04-candle-reconstruction.md](../operations-and-compliance/08-04-candle-reconstruction.md)); `None` (omitted on the wire) for live candles. The flag is forwarded through aggregation chains so a macro candle is marked `reconstructed` if any constituent sub-candle is reconstructed. |

> **Field-name registry.** Three surfaces share the same conceptual `NormalizedCandle` but use slightly different field names. Downstream docs cite one of the three names with a `(wire | struct | db)` annotation when the surface matters for the reader.
>
> **Candle provenance flag** — three names, one concept:
> - **Rust struct** (`crates/core-domain/src/normalized/mod.rs::NormalizedCandle`): `reconstructed: Option<ReconstructionMethod>`.
> - **Wire JSON** (this matrix): `reconstructed` — same name, value omitted on live candles via `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`.
> - **SQLite column** ([06-02-database-schema-spec.md §3.1](../integration-and-api/06-02-database-schema-spec.md)): `reconstruction_method TEXT` — the persistence layer maps the Rust `reconstructed` field to the column on insert/select. The naming difference is intentional (the column belongs to a wider SQLite provenance family of `*_method` columns) and the mapping is enforced at the persistence boundary.
>
> **Candle timestamp** — two names:
> - **Rust struct** (`NormalizedCandle`): `start_time_ms: u64` (candle open time, Unix epoch milliseconds).
> - **Wire JSON** (this matrix): `timestamp: u64` (candle close time, Unix epoch milliseconds).
> - The two are equivalent up to one `duration_ms` offset: `wire.timestamp = struct.start_time_ms + struct.duration_ms`.
>
> **Candle duration** — two names:
> - **Rust struct**: `duration_ms: u64` (milliseconds).
> - **Wire JSON**: `timeframe_secs: u64` (seconds).
> - The two are equivalent: `struct.duration_ms = wire.timeframe_secs * 1_000`. v6.0 retains both names because the seconds-vs-milliseconds unit difference carries semantic value: `timeframe_secs` makes the ladder (`60`, `180`, `300`, `900`) human-readable; `duration_ms` makes boundary arithmetic (see [01-04-timeframe-model.md §3.1](../conceptual-foundations/01-04-timeframe-model.md)) direct.

## 3. JSON Serialization Contract

```json
{
  "exchange": "Hyperliquid",
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "timeframe_secs": 60,
  "timestamp": 1752192000000,
  "open": 63890.0,
  "high": 64120.0,
  "low": 63850.0,
  "close": 64012.5,
  "volume": 182.4,
  "trades_count": 345
}
```

---

## 4. Multi-Timeframe Output

The Market Data Layer produces candles at the 10 fixed ladder timeframes simultaneously (`1s`…`1h`). Each timeframe has its own independent aggregation buffer per symbol.
