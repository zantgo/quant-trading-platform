# Risk Matrix Specification

**Version:** 11.8 (2026-09-16) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.
**Status:** Approved
**Engine:** Market Monitoring Engine (MME)
**Producing Layer:** Layer 5 — Risk Layer
**Purpose:** This document defines the physical schema and unipolar scoring model of the **Risk Matrix** — the direction-independent threat-assessment object. The Risk Matrix contains **eight unipolar danger sub-dimensions** plus `overall_risk` (the weighted aggregate of those eight) — **nine fields total** on a `0–100` unipolar scale. *(Phase 3 added `cascade_risk` for liquidation-cascade danger; the legacy `liquidity_risk` was renamed to `execution_liquidity_risk` to free the "liquidity" term for the positional concept.)*

---

## 1. Conceptual Definition

Per the [Ontology](../conceptual-foundations/01-01-ontology.md) §3.15, **Risk** is the structural, technical, and environmental danger present in the market — **independent of directional bias**. A bullish market can be high risk; a bearish market can be low risk.

Crucially, Risk is a property of an *interpretation*, not of raw observations: you cannot evaluate how risky a bullish trend is until you have first determined that a bullish trend exists. The Risk Matrix therefore consumes the [Analysis Matrix](02-02-analysis-matrix.md) plus the underlying [Metrics Matrix](02-07-metrics-matrix.md) indicators.

**R:R exclusion (v6.10.12, RR-001).** L5 is direction-independent danger and **never** surfaces an R:R — reward synthesis belongs to L4 (geometric) and L6 (risk-adjusted) only.

**L4/L5 strict orthogonality (institutional redesign).** L5 does **not** consume the L4 Opportunity Matrix. The Layer 4 (Opportunity) and Layer 5 (Risk) branches are strictly orthogonal at the matrix boundary: each reads L3 directly and runs in parallel. **Reward evaluation is a synthesis** and has been moved to the [Decision Matrix (L6)](02-04-decision-matrix.md) as the new `entry_danger` field. The Risk Matrix contains **eight unipolar danger sub-dimensions** plus `overall_risk` (the weighted aggregate) — nine fields total — no reward synthesis.

## 2. Physical Schema

### 2.1 RiskMatrix Fields (9 Dimensions)

| Field | Type | Threat Vector |
|-------|------|---------------|
| `symbol` | `string` | Entity under analysis. |
| `market_risk` | `RiskDimension` | General uncertainty from conflicting signals / weak structure. |
| `volatility_risk` | `RiskDimension` | Danger from abnormal price movement. |
| `execution_liquidity_risk` | `RiskDimension` | Poor market participation / thin volume. (Renamed from `liquidity_risk` in Phase 3 to free the term "liquidity" for the new positional concept.) |
| `structure_risk` | `RiskDimension` | Weak or damaged price structure. |
| `momentum_risk` | `RiskDimension` | Exhausted / diverging momentum. |
| `signal_risk` | `RiskDimension` | Conflicting or unreliable signals. |
| `execution_risk` | `RiskDimension` | Practical difficulty (spread, slippage, thin book). **v6.11:** carries the optional `volatility_to_spread_ratio` field (see §2.2). |
| `cascade_risk` | `RiskDimension` | Forced liquidation cascade danger. *(Added in Phase 3 — computed from `LiquidityFlow.cascade_intensity`, `cascade_state`, and `LiquidationClusterMatrix.cascade_asymmetry`.)* |
| `overall_risk` | `RiskDimension` | Weighted aggregate of the eight sub-dimensions above. |

### 2.2 RiskDimension

| Field | Type | Range | Description |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| `score` | `f64` | `[0, 100]` | **Unipolar** risk score — higher is riskier. |
| `level` | `RiskLevel` | — | Wire values (PascalCase): `VeryLow` / `Low` / `Moderate` / `High` / `Extreme`. |
| `state` | `RiskState` | — | Wire values (PascalCase): `Stable` / `Increasing` / `Elevated` / `Critical` / `Improving`. **Functional since v6.10.9** — derived by `derive_risk_state` (level escalation `≥ 80 → Critical`, `≥ 60 → Elevated`, else the previous-synthesis delta `> +10 → Increasing`, `< −10 → Improving`, else `Stable`). Descriptive only — it never feeds back into the weighted sum. |
| `confidence` | `f64` | `[0, 100]` | Confidence in the measurement. |
| `evidence` | `string[]` | — | Human-readable contributing factors. |
| `volatility_to_spread_ratio` | `f64?` | — | **v6.11.** `ATR(14) ÷ top-of-book bid-ask spread` (raw price units) — execution-friction gauge. Populated **only** on `execution_risk`; absent (`Option::None`, omitted from the wire) on the other eight dimensions. A high ratio (e.g. `> 10`) means the average candle range dwarfs transaction cost (scalp-friendly); a low ratio (e.g. `< 1.5`) means spread friction consumes potential profits. |

### 2.3 RiskLevel Bands

```
score ≥ 80 → Extreme
score ≥ 60 → High
score ≥ 40 → Moderate
score ≥ 20 → Low
otherwise  → VeryLow
```

---

**Volatility risk (v6.10.18 I-8).** The dimension blends three components: a base `30` + BBWP band (extreme expansion `90+` → +30, elevated `70+` → +15, squeeze → +10), the **actionable-horizon TF volatility state** (`0.7 × micro + 0.3 × fast` L2 vol scores, each on the 0–100 unipolar scale, evidence lists every window's state), and a relative-ATR modifier that only fires at `1%+` of price (it can no longer drag a sub-0.1% BTC print to LOW beside a climax window). The 13:25 capture — micro EXPANDING (83), fast EXPANSION_CLIMAX (97), BBWP 78.5 — reads **66 (HIGH)** with the states in the evidence, replacing the old 23 (LOW) that contradicted its own "BBWP elevated" evidence.

## 3. Unipolar Scoring Principle

Unlike the signed `[-1, 1]` scores of the Metrics/Analysis matrices, all Risk scores are **unipolar** in `[0, 100]`. Direction is deliberately discarded — the Risk Matrix answers *"how dangerous is the current environment?"*, never *"which way?"*. This lets the Decision Matrix combine an orthogonal danger axis with the directional bias axis.

---

## 4. Per-Dimension Assessment Contracts

Each assessment starts from a baseline and adjusts by additive evidence. Threshold tiers within a dimension are non-cumulative; only the highest satisfied tier applies (e.g. in §4.2, BBWP 95 yields +30, not +30 + 15 = +45). All final scores clamp to `[0, 100]`.

### 4.1 Market Risk (baseline 50)
```
+15 weak trend · +15 broken structure · +10 poor quality
+10 low state_confidence (<0.4) · +10 conflicting signals present
-10 strong trend · -10 high state_confidence (>0.7)
```

> **Rename note.** The previous name "analysis confidence" was renamed to `state_confidence` in the institutional redesign (see [02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md §3](../matrices/02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md)). Implementations read the L3 field as `state_confidence`, not `confidence`.

### 4.2 Volatility Risk (baseline 30)
```
+30 BBWP ≥ 90 (extreme expansion) · +15 BBWP ≥ 70
+10 squeeze compression active
if ATR present: score = mean(score, relative_atr)
```

### 4.3 Execution Liquidity Risk (baseline 30)
```
+30 RVOL < 0.5 · +15 RVOL < 0.8 · -15 RVOL > 2.0
+20 spread > 0.2% · -10 spread < 0.05%
```

### 4.4 Structure Risk (baseline 40)
```
+30 structure broken · +15 structure weak · -15 structure strong/healthy
+15 S/R level flip detected
```

### 4.5 Momentum Risk (baseline 30)
```
+40 momentum exhausted · +30 reversing · +15 weakening · -10 increasing
```

### 4.6 Signal Risk (baseline 30)
```
+min(10·n, 40) for n contradicting signals
+10 no signals active · +15 state_confidence < 0.5
```

> **Rename note.** Same rename as above: the L3 field is `state_confidence`. The trigger `state_confidence < 0.5` reads the L3 field directly.

### 4.7 Execution Risk (baseline 25)
```
+25 spread > 0.15% · +10 spread > 0.08%
+15 RVOL < 0.7 (low participation)
+15 volatility_to_spread_ratio < 1.5 (spread friction dominates the environment)
+5  volatility_to_spread_ratio < 3.0 (moderate friction)
−5  volatility_to_spread_ratio > 10.0 (range-to-cost favorable — execution-friendly)
```

**v6.11 ratio rule.** `volatility_to_spread_ratio = ATR(14) ÷ (ask − bid)` in raw price units. The ratio tiers are non-cumulative (only the highest satisfied tier applies, per the §4 preamble); the ratio's evidence string always quotes the numeric value (e.g. `"Low volatility-to-spread (1.2)"`, `"Favorable volatility-to-spread (12.4)"`). When ATR or spread is unavailable/zero the ratio is `None` and no ratio tier fires.

> **v6.10.21 unit fix.** The `spread` indicator's `raw_value` is a **percentage** of mid price (`(ask − bid) / mid × 100`). The ratio converts it to raw price units first (`spread / 100 × close`) before dividing ATR — the legacy behavior divided ATR by the percentage scalar directly (e.g. a real BTC-USDC spread of `0.000568 %` produced a meaningless `≈2659` instead of the true `≈4.2`).

### 4.8 Cascade Risk (baseline 30, Phase 3)

Cascade risk quantifies the danger from forced liquidation cascades. It consumes the [Liquidity Matrix](02-12-liquidity-matrix.md) (`LiquidityFlow`) and the [Liquidation Cluster Matrix](02-13-liquidation-cluster-matrix.md) (`LiquidationClusterMatrix`). The derivation mirrors `crates/core-domain/src/risk.rs::assess_cascade_risk`:

```
score = baseline 30.0
score = max(score, flow.cascade_intensity)                       // pull in 0..100 intensity
+30  if flow.cascade_state == Sustained                          // premium 0..30 per state
+15  if flow.cascade_state == Detected                           // premium 0..15 per state
 +0  if flow.cascade_state == Exhausted                          // decaying, no premium
+0..30  if |cluster.cascade_asymmetry| > 0.3                     // forward-looking pressure
+0..15  per OI-price-divergence liquidity signal (positioning stress, ×strength/100)
+0..10  per funding-flip liquidity signal (crowd positioning stress, ×strength/100)
```

Evidence strings record the cascade state (when active), any significant cluster asymmetry, and the AUDIT-AIU-062 discrete-signal bonuses (OI-price divergence / funding flip — capped at +25 total; scores clamp at 100).

### 4.9 Overall Risk (weighted aggregate)

The overall risk score is a weighted aggregate of the **eight sub-dimensions** (no `expected_rr` — reward synthesis lives at the [Decision Layer](02-04-decision-matrix.md) as `entry_danger`). Final normalized weights are defined in [MME Layer 5 §3](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-06-mme-layer5-risk.md) and applied by `crates/core-domain/src/risk.rs::compute_risk`.

> **Self-consistency check (v2.1 — correction).** The JSON example below uses the eight sub-dimension scores `(M=35, V=45, L_ex=15, S=25, Mo=20, Sig=30, E=25, C=30)`. Plugging these into the canonical weighted formula `0.14·M + 0.14·V + 0.14·L_ex + 0.10·S + 0.14·Mo + 0.10·Sig + 0.10·E + 0.14·C`:
>
> `0.14·35 + 0.14·45 + 0.14·15 + 0.10·25 + 0.14·20 + 0.10·30 + 0.10·25 + 0.14·30 = 4.9 + 6.3 + 2.1 + 2.5 + 2.8 + 3.0 + 2.5 + 4.2 = 28.3`
>
> The previous example value `28.75` was internally inconsistent with the formula. The corrected `overall_risk.score = 28.3` is the authoritative worked example; this value cascades into the Decision Matrix §6 example (`confidence_assessment = 71.7`, `expected_reward_risk_ratio = 1.79`).

---

## 5. JSON Serialization Contract

A representative Risk Matrix frame. The example illustrates the JSON shape and the `score → level` band translation from §2.3. Per-dimension derivation rules are in §4.

```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "market_risk":     { "score": 35.0, "level": "Low",      "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0, "evidence": ["High confidence"] },
  "volatility_risk": { "score": 45.0, "level": "Moderate", "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0, "evidence": ["BBWP elevated"] },
  "execution_liquidity_risk": { "score": 15.0, "level": "VeryLow", "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0, "evidence": ["Strong participation"] },
  "structure_risk":  { "score": 25.0, "level": "Low",      "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0 },
  "momentum_risk":   { "score": 20.0, "level": "Low",      "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0 },
  "signal_risk":     { "score": 30.0, "level": "Low",      "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0 },
  "execution_risk":  { "score": 25.0, "level": "Low",      "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0, "volatility_to_spread_ratio": 8.4 },
  "cascade_risk":    { "score": 30.0, "level": "Low",      "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0 },
  "overall_risk":    { "score": 28.3, "level": "Low",      "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0 }
}
```

Empty `evidence` arrays are omitted. `RiskLevel` / `RiskState` values serialize as **PascalCase** on the wire (as shown above); the SCREAMING forms (`VERY_LOW`, `CRITICAL`, …) are the `Display` vocabulary. `volatility_to_spread_ratio` is `Option<f64>` — omitted from the wire when `None` (all dimensions except `execution_risk`). The `confidence` range matches the code: `[0, 100]` (the RiskDimension `confidence` field carries `state_confidence × 100`).

---

## 6. Empty State

When `analysis.timeframes_considered == 0`, `compute_risk` returns `RiskMatrix::empty()` — all **nine fields** (market, volatility, execution_liquidity, structure, momentum, signal, execution, cascade, overall_risk) defaulting to score `50.0` (`MODERATE`), reflecting maximal uncertainty in the absence of data. `volatility_to_spread_ratio` is `None` in the empty state (absent from the wire).

---

## 7. Design Guarantees

| Property | Guarantee |
|----------|-----------|
| **Direction independence** | No dimension references bullish/bearish direction. |
| **Unipolar bounding** | Every score clamps to `[0, 100]`. |
| **Explainability** | Each dimension exposes an `evidence` list of contributing factors. |
| **Additive determinism** | Scores are deterministic functions of the Analysis Matrix + indicator map. |
| **Scheme-A badge mapping (v6.10.19d, display-only)** | The dashboard maps each dimension to one Scheme-A token badge — trend states win (`INCREASING → RISING ↗`, `IMPROVING → IMPROVING ↘`), otherwise the LEVEL maps to its token (`Extreme→CRITICAL ⚠`, `High→ELEVATED ↑`, `Moderate→STEADY →`, `Low→COMPOSED →`, `VeryLow→MINIMAL →`). The level name keeps its wording (Extreme/High/…) tinted by the token color; `state_display` mirrors the `{icon} {TOKEN}` badges. **Display-only:** the mapping lives in the Risk panel + export and never feeds back into the backend (the wire `state` / `level` fields are unchanged). The hero is a risk progress bar (score `/100`, level-colored, tooltip "Overall risk — lower is safer") with the **Assessment Confidence** badge (tooltip "Confidence of the risk assessment — higher is more trustworthy") and the **`Top risk:`** label when the highest-severity dimension outranks the overall level. |
