# Decision Matrix Specification

**Version:** 11.11 (2026-09-18) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.
**Status:** Approved
**Engine:** Market Monitoring Engine (MME)
**Producing Layer:** Layer 6 — Decision Layer
**Purpose:** This document defines the physical schema of the **Decision Matrix** — the strategic decision-support object. It synthesizes bias (Analysis), value (Opportunity), and vulnerability (Risk) into structured, human-facing guidance: trade readiness, directional guidance, dynamic protection strategy, target strategy, and scenario pathways. It is the terminal output the Trade Automation Engine consumes.

---

## 1. Conceptual Definition

Per the [Ontology](../conceptual-foundations/01-01-ontology.md) §3.16, **Decision Support** transforms market intelligence into actionable tactical guidance **without making autonomous execution choices**. It answers *"given everything we understand, what is the recommended posture — and what would change it?"*.

The Decision Matrix is realized by two complementary structures:

1. **`AdvisoryMatrix`** (`crates/core-domain/src/advisory.rs`) — the human-facing guidance layer (directional guidance, stance, entry/exit/protection/target strategy).
2. **`DecisionContext`** (`crates/core-domain/src/decision_context.rs`) — the quantitative decision metadata (score, bias, confidence, contributing indicators).

## 2. Decision Matrix Schema (AdvisoryMatrix fields)

> **Type-Boundary Note.** The `protection_strategy` (§3.6) resolves to a concrete **`stop_loss_distance_pct`**, which is represented as an **`f64`** (a raw percentage float, e.g. `1.5` = 1.5%). This `f64` is the canonical **type-boundary handoff variable** between the MME (hot path, `f64`) and the TAE (cold path, `Decimal`): the TAE casts it to `Decimal` at the execution boundary before sizing (see [Global Architecture §6.3](../conceptual-foundations/01-02-global-architecture.md) and [TAE Layer 2 §2.1](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-03-tae-layer2-execution.md)).
>
> **Removed in the institutional redesign.** The previous `opportunity_type` field has been **removed** from the Decision Matrix. The Decision Layer reads `Opportunity.primary_opportunity` directly from the L4 Opportunity Matrix. The `OpportunityClass` enum that the removed field used is now sourced from L4; see [02-00-matrix-field-ownership.md](02-00-matrix-field-ownership.md).

### 2.1 AdvisoryMatrix Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `symbol` | `string` | Entity. |
| `directional_guidance` | `DirectionalGuidance` | Recommended directional posture (§3.1). |
| `market_stance` | `MarketStance` | Aggressiveness posture (§3.2). |
| `strategy_environment` | `StrategyEnvironment` | Which strategy family the environment favours (§3.3). |
| `entry_guidance` | `EntryGuidance` | How to time entry (§3.4). |
| `exit_guidance` | `ExitGuidance` | Early-warning exit trigger (§3.5). |
| `protection_strategy` | `ProtectionStrategy` | How to place the stop (§3.6). |
| `target_strategy` | `TargetStrategy` | How to place the target (§3.7). |
| `stop_loss_distance_pct` | `f64` | Concrete stop-loss distance as a raw percentage float (e.g. `1.5` = 1.5%). Type-boundary handoff from MME (f64) to TAE (Decimal cast at the execution boundary). Computed from the active `protection_strategy` (§3.6) and the current volatility inputs — **not** ATR-derived (see §3.6 for the exact formula). |
| `confidence_assessment` | `f64` | Guidance confidence in `[0, 100]`. |
| `opportunity_classification` | `OpportunityClass` | Bucketed L4 classification (`Intraday`/`Swing`/`Position`) carried into the advisory. |
| `cascade_risk_score` | `f64` | L5 cascade dimension score (0–100) surfaced for the environment assessment. |
| `environment_favorability` | `f64` | Synoptic L3+L4 favorability (0–100) for entering. |
| `quality_to_risk_ratio` | `f64?` | **v6.11.** Setup-efficiency metric — the forward-looking "is the risk justified by the setup?" ratio: `analysis.market_quality_score ÷ risk.overall_risk.score` (both unipolar `[0, 100]`; higher = better). Rendered as the **Quality/Risk** KPI on the Recommendation panel, adjacent to Entry Danger. `null`/absent when `overall_risk.score == 0` (division guard). |
| `final_recommendation` | `string` | Natural-language recommendation summary. |

> **Field placement (wire contract).** `trade_readiness`, `entry_danger`, and `expected_reward_risk_ratio` live on **`DecisionContext`** (§2.2), **not** on `AdvisoryMatrix` — the wire nests them under `decision_context`. `AdvisoryMatrix` carries the guidance enums, `stop_loss_distance_pct`, `confidence_assessment`, `quality_to_risk_ratio`, and `final_recommendation`.

### 2.2 DecisionContext Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `score` | `f64` | Quantitative confluence score. |
| `bias` | `MarketBias` (5-state) | `STRONG_BULLISH` / `BULLISH` / `NEUTRAL` / `BEARISH` / `STRONG_BEARISH`. **Same 5-state vocabulary as `Analysis.bias`** — no 3-state collapse is applied. Wire value is the PascalCase serde form (`"StrongBullish"`, …). |
| `score_confidence` | `f64` | `[0, 1]` derived from `|score| / 100`. *(Renamed from `confidence` in the institutional redesign; see [02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md](02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md).)* |
| `contributing_indicators` | `string[]` | Indicators driving the decision. |
| `trade_readiness` | `TradeReadiness` | Headline readiness state (§4). `READY` / `FORMING` / `WATCH` / `STAND_ASIDE` — a plain wire `String` carrying the SCREAMING values (not a serde enum). *(Populated on `DecisionContext`; previously documented in §2.1 as an `AdvisoryMatrix` field.)* |
| `entry_danger` | `RiskDimension` | Synoptic measure of how dangerous the current interpretive state is for entering a new position. High score = dangerous (do not enter); low score = safe to enter. Synthesized from L3 `market_quality` and L4 `opportunity_score` — see §3.8 for the derivation rule. *(Renamed from `risk_favorability` in v2.1; semantic successor of `Risk.expected_rr`.)* |
| `expected_reward_risk_ratio` | `f64` | Synthesized from the active-side R:R (`L4.long_expected_rr_internal` for bullish bias, `L4.short_expected_rr_internal` for bearish, 0 for Neutral) × `(1 − L5.overall_risk / 100.0)`. The legacy matrix-level `L4.expected_rr_internal` was removed in v6.9. **UI label (v6.10.12): `Risk-Adj R:R`** — distinct from the L4 geometric `R:R`; the Safety-Flags KPI, the why-bullets, and the plan strip use this label (v6.10.19d D: the L6 header chip was removed — the KPI row is the single header-adjacent surface). |
| `long_probability` | `f64` | **Canonical source of truth.** Long-side normalized probability (0–100, integer). Sums to 100 with `short_probability` + `hold_probability`. Computed server-side from the signed confluence score modulated by directional guidance, market stance, and R:R — see §2.4 for the derivation formula. |
| `short_probability` | `f64` | Short-side normalized probability (0–100, integer). |
| `hold_probability` | `f64` | Hold (no-position) normalized probability (0–100, integer). |
| `net_bias_pct` | `f64` | Net directional bias in percentage points (`long − short`), range `[−100, +100]`. Positive = net long-leaning, negative = net short-leaning. |
| `lean_floor_applied` | `bool` | **v6.10.19 (P6).** `true` when the graded-lean floors actually adjusted the split (HOLD capped at 60% and/or the directional arm raised to 15%) — see the §4 lean-floor transparency note. |

### 2.3 `confluence_score` formula (canonical)

The Decision Matrix's `decision_context.score` is a weighted blend of three upstream dimensions, computed at synthesis time:

```
decision_context.score = 0.50 · alignment.tradability_dim
                       + 0.30 · analysis.market_quality_score
                       + 0.20 · opportunity.opportunity_score
```

> **Signed vs unsigned (v6.10.16).** The blend above is **unsigned** `[0, 100]` — the wire `score` is that blend signed by `Analysis.bias` (`+` Bullish, `−` Bearish, **`0` when bias is Neutral**, see `decision_context.rs`). A Neutral bias therefore zeroes the signed score even when the blend is strong (e.g. ≈63) — the Recommendation panel's why-line now reports both: `confluence score 0 (…blend…) — signed 0 because Neutral bias zeroes the directional blend (unsigned ≈ 63)`. The L3 grace band (02-02 §3.1, v6.10.16) rescues coherent TF votes from that zeroing so a 4:0-vote market carries its direction.

> **Signed vs unsigned (v6.10.16).** The blend above is **unsigned** `[0, 100]` — the wire `score` is that blend signed by `Analysis.bias` (`+` Bullish, `−` Bearish, **`0` when bias is Neutral**, see `decision_context.rs`). A Neutral bias therefore zeroes the signed score even when the blend is strong (e.g. ≈63) — the why-line in the Recommendation panel now reports both: `confluence score 0 (…blend…) — signed 0 because Neutral bias zeroes the directional blend (unsigned ≈ 63)`. The L3 grace band (02-02 §3.1, v6.10.16) rescues coherent TF votes from the Neutral zeroing so a 4:0-vote market carries its direction.

where `alignment.tradability_dim` is dimension 9 of the [Alignment Matrix](../matrices/02-01-alignment-matrix.md) (renamed from "Opportunity" in the institutional redesign because L4 owns opportunity concepts; this dimension measures cross-TF agreement on tradability), `analysis.market_quality_score` is the L3 quality score in `[0, 100]`, and `opportunity.opportunity_score` is the L4 score in `[0, 100]`. Weights sum to 1.00.

The canonical worked example below (§6) recomputes under this formula.

### 2.4 `long/short/hold_probability` derivation (canonical)

The three percentage fields (`long_probability`, `short_probability`, `hold_probability`) together with `net_bias_pct` form the **server-side source of truth** for directional probability. They are computed from the same inputs using the same 5-step algorithm the frontend previously ran locally (`ui/src/lib/decisionRank.ts`). When present in the wire, the frontend consumes them directly; when absent (legacy payloads), the frontend falls back to local computation.

**Algorithm.** The five steps are run in `DecisionContext::compute()` (`crates/core-domain/src/decision_context.rs`):

1. **Raw signal scores** (`∈ [0, 100]`):
   ```
   base_long  = clamp(0, 100, max(0, effective_score) × effective_confidence)
   base_short = clamp(0, 100, max(0, −effective_score) × effective_confidence)
   base_hold  = clamp(0, 100, (entry_danger / 100) × 50)
   ```
   `effective_score` is the signed confluence score (from the bias sign + `confluence_score` magnitude). When the score is zero (Neutral bias), a geometric offset is applied: the top-scored qualifying opportunity profile's score is multiplied by `±0.15` depending on which direction has more zone support. `effective_confidence` = `max(score_confidence, 0.5)`.

2. **Directional modulation.** The `directional_guidance` (re-derived from `Analysis.bias` × `Risk.overall_risk` using the canonical §3.1 table) amplifies its own side by `1.2×` and attenuates the opposite side by `0.5×`. Neutral guidance has no effect.

> **Lifted-bias override (v6.10.17).** A bias produced by the margin
> machinery (grace band, hysteresis hold, or the LEAN tier — see
> 02-02 §3.1, `bias_lifted()`) is **always directional** in this step,
> bypassing the risk gate of §3.1 rows 5/9 — a minimal 3:1-vote
> confirmation with composite 2.6 at risk 41.87 produces a graded
> directional split instead of a 96% HOLD. Plain (non-lifted) biases
> keep the risk gate exactly as documented. `DecisionContext::compute`
> and `AdvisoryMatrix::compute_advisory` share the same override so the
> guidance and the percentages can never contradict each other.

3. **Stance modulation.** `market_stance` (re-derived from `MarketQuality` × `overall_risk` using the canonical §3.2 table):
   - `AGGRESSIVE` or `CONSTRUCTIVE`: amplify the guided side by `1.15×`.
   - `AVOID`: halve both directional sides (`0.5×`) and amplify hold by `1.5×`.

4. **R:R modulation.** When `expected_reward_risk_ratio` is a real sub-1.0 value (`0 < rr < 1.0`), the **bias side** is penalized by `0.6×`. **v6.10.17:** a MISSING R:R (0 — no-clear matrices, warmup) is unknown, not bad, and no longer triggers the penalty — only an actual bad R:R does. **v6.10.18 (I-1b):** the penalty keys to the BIAS direction, not the §3.1 guidance — when the risk gate produces Neutral guidance at elevated risk (plain Bullish, risk ≥ 40), the poor bracket must STILL cap the directional conviction (a trader rejects "worse R:R → higher conviction"). The graded-lean floors (step 5) are bias-keyed the same way.

5. **Renormalization & floor.** The three modulated values are renormalized so `long + short + hold = 100`, then a 2% minimum floor is applied. **Graded-lean floors (v6.10.17):** whenever a directional read exists, HOLD is additionally capped at **60%** and the directional arm is floored at **15%** before the final renormalization — the distribution can never collapse into a 96% HOLD next to a minimal bullish/bearish confirmation. The 2% floor (and thus the 96%-HOLD shape) survives ONLY in the genuinely flat state (Neutral bias, no directional offset). This is the release gate that keeps the panel sensitive: HOLD ≥ 90% is the exception, not the norm.

The computation above is **identical on the backend and the frontend fallback** — the two paths share the same formulas, same inputs, and same modulation tables. The backend version additionally uses the exact `MarketStance`/`DirectionalGuidance` derivation tables from `compute_advisory()` (rather than the advisory wire fields) so the percentages are self-consistent within the `DecisionContext` envelope.

> **Verdict lean from valid setups (G3, v6.10.19b).** The verdict `top` (the UI-side resolution over the backend probabilities) respects VALID SETUPS: when the split is hold-dominant (`top = HOLD`) but a qualifying setup with a resolvable side exists, the verdict leans to that side with its REAL probability (e.g. `LONG lean 12% — STAND ASIDE` on a 12/2/86 split with a qualifying LONG-side setup). The probabilities, readiness and execution gate are unchanged — only the top-action label becomes setup-aware. This is the "it should not say HOLD when a valid setup exists" rule; a genuine flat HOLD (no qualifying setup, e.g. 2/2/96 No Clear) keeps the neutral verdict.
>
> **Verdict-consistent Recommendation `top_setup` (B1 v6.10.19b + D3 v6.10.19c).** The Recommendation panel's single SETUP card is the **verdict-consistent headline**: under a directional verdict it is the best qualifying profile ON that side, else the verdict-side aggregated reference bracket (`viability: NoClear`, informational); under HOLD with qualifying profiles it is the top qualifying profile (any side, incl. NEUTRAL — a real setup is never hidden behind a placeholder); under HOLD with no qualifying profiles it is the clean **"No Active Setup"** empty container (fields null, no badges). Counter-bias qualifying setups ride in `alternate_qualifying_setups` and always appear on the Opportunities panel (parity invariant, `02-08`). Both rules are panel compositions over the unchanged `DecisionContext` — no wire field depends upward.
>
> **Risk-Adj R:R is bracket-aware (D4, v6.10.19c).** The Safety-Flags KPI displays the risk-discounted ratio whenever the container has a bracket (v6.10.19d D: the L6 header chip was removed): backend `expected_reward_risk_ratio` when > 0, else `container bracket R:R × (1 − L5.overall_risk/100)`; `N/A` only when there is genuinely no bracket or the ratio falls below the 0.10 meaningfulness floor. A NEUTRAL-side setup's bracket R:R is computed from its populated zones (populated-side math) — never blanked by "no directional bias" when zones exist.

## 3. Guidance Vocabularies

### 3.1 DirectionalGuidance
`STRONG_LONG`, `LONG`, `NEUTRAL`, `SHORT`, `STRONG_SHORT`, `AVOID_DIRECTIONAL_EXPOSURE`.

**Wire values (PascalCase):** `StrongLong` / `Long` / `Neutral` / `Short` / `StrongShort` / `AvoidDirectionalExposure`.

Derived from `bias × overall_risk × market_stance`:
```
# Priority order (first match wins):
1. market_stance = AVOID                                  → AVOID_DIRECTIONAL_EXPOSURE
2. STRONG_BULLISH + risk<50                               → STRONG_LONG
3. STRONG_BULLISH + risk≥50                               → LONG
4. BULLISH         + risk<40                              → LONG
5. BULLISH         + risk≥40                              → NEUTRAL
6. STRONG_BEARISH  + risk<50                             → STRONG_SHORT
7. STRONG_BEARISH  + risk≥50                             → SHORT
8. BEARISH         + risk<40                              → SHORT
9. BEARISH         + risk≥40                              → NEUTRAL
10. NEUTRAL                                                 → NEUTRAL
```

All six `DirectionalGuidance` values are reachable. The `AVOID_DIRECTIONAL_EXPOSURE` guard at priority 1 ensures the L6 output correctly reflects the L6's own `market_stance = AVOID` determination (e.g. when the L6 stance is forced AVOID by a PME veto or a system safety trigger).

> **Lifted-bias override (v6.10.17, unit-corrected v6.10.18).** Rows 5
> and 9 (`BULLISH/BEARISH + risk ≥ 40 → NEUTRAL`) are bypassed when the
> bias is **lifted** (grace / hysteresis / LEAN — the wire FRACTION
> `|market_bias_score| ≤ 0.2`, i.e. a composite ≤ 20, with a directional
> bias): a lifted read is directional by construction and the risk gate
> must not silence it (the readiness gate still governs execution).
> Mirrored in `DecisionContext` and `compute_advisory`. v6.10.18 fixed
> a unit bug where the fraction was compared against ±20 directly —
> EVERY directional bias was treated as lifted and the risk gate was
> silently dead.

> **Reachability and gating.** Priority 1 (`market_stance = AVOID`) is the **only** path to `AVOID_DIRECTIONAL_EXPOSURE`. This is intentional: the L6 `DirectionalGuidance` is conditional on the L6 `MarketStance` (see §3.2 below), and an `AVOID` stance is itself determined by `market_quality` and `overall_risk` (e.g. `market_quality ∈ {POOR}` or `overall_risk ≥ 80`). The derivation table above is therefore only "live" when `market_stance ∈ {AGGRESSIVE, CONSTRUCTIVE, NEUTRAL, CAUTIOUS}`; whenever the L6 `MarketStance` becomes `AVOID`, every bias × risk combination below priority 1 collapses to `AVOID_DIRECTIONAL_EXPOSURE`. `MarketStance` (L6 environmental assessment) and `Stance` (PME per-symbol execution authorization) are independent enums — see the disambiguation note in §4 below.

### 3.2 MarketStance
`AGGRESSIVE`, `CONSTRUCTIVE`, `NEUTRAL`, `CAUTIOUS`, `AVOID`.

**Wire values (PascalCase):** `Aggressive` / `Constructive` / `Neutral` / `Cautious` / `Avoid`.

Derived from `market_quality × overall_risk` (exact mirror of `compute_advisory`, v6.10.17 — the previous table claimed `POOR` alone → `AVOID`, but the code requires `POOR` **and** `overall_risk ≥ 80`; a poor-quality-but-calm market is `CAUTIOUS`, not `AVOID`):
```
# Priority order (first match wins):
1. market_quality = POOR      AND overall_risk ≥ 80                       → AVOID
2. market_quality = EXCELLENT AND overall_risk ≥ 80                       → AVOID
3. market_quality ∈ {POOR, WEAK}                                          → CAUTIOUS
4. market_quality = AVERAGE   AND overall_risk <  40                      → NEUTRAL
5. market_quality = GOOD      AND overall_risk <  30                      → CONSTRUCTIVE
6. market_quality = EXCELLENT AND overall_risk <  20                      → AGGRESSIVE
7. market_quality = EXCELLENT AND overall_risk <  30                      → CONSTRUCTIVE
8. otherwise                                                              → CAUTIOUS  (default)
```

> **Unit convention.** The `overall_risk` thresholds above are on the canonical `[0, 100]` unipolar scale (matching the [Risk Matrix](../matrices/02-11-risk-matrix.md) `RiskDimension.score` unit). The thresholds `80 / 60 / 40 / 30 / 20` correspond to the documented bands in §3.8; the fractional form (`0.80`, `0.60`, `0.40`, `0.30`, `0.20`) would map `overall_risk = 28.3` to "above the AVOID threshold" and is not used.

All five `MarketStance` values are reachable. `AVOID` requires a **combination** — `POOR` or `EXCELLENT` quality AND `overall_risk ≥ 80` (a rich-market blowup, not a mediocre calm market); `CAUTIOUS` is the catch-all for poor/weak quality and everything else. Note the tightened risk thresholds for the higher-quality stances: AGGRESSIVE requires risk < 20, CONSTRUCTIVE requires risk < 30. The previous version had CONSTRUCTIVE at risk < 60 and AGGRESSIVE at risk < 40, which created a counterintuitive situation where a mediocre setup (`AVERAGE` quality) with elevated risk could still yield `CONSTRUCTIVE` (via the default rule). The tightened thresholds eliminate this anti-pattern.

> **Default-stance rationale.** The default fallback is `CAUTIOUS`, which preserves monotonic escalation: as risk rises, the stance retreats `CONSTRUCTIVE → NEUTRAL → CAUTIOUS → AVOID` without ever advancing again. Choosing `CONSTRUCTIVE` as the default would create the inverse anomaly (higher-risk environments with `POOR` quality receiving a more aggressive stance than lower-risk ones via the same rule, since `CONSTRUCTIVE` would be the unconditional fall-through while `AVOID` requires `POOR`-quality to fire).

### 3.3 StrategyEnvironment
`TREND_FOLLOWING`, `BREAKOUT`, `MEAN_REVERSION`, `HIGH_VOLATILITY`, `LOW_ACTIVITY`, `UNFAVORABLE` — from `market_regime` ([Analysis Matrix §3.2](../matrices/02-02-analysis-matrix.md)):

**Wire values (PascalCase):** `TrendFollowing` / `Breakout` / `MeanReversion` / `HighVolatility` / `LowActivity` / `Unfavorable`.

| `MarketRegime` | `StrategyEnvironment` |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| `TRENDING_BULL` / `TRENDING_BEAR` | `TREND_FOLLOWING` |
| `ACCUMULATION` / `DISTRIBUTION` | `BREAKOUT` |
| `RANGE` | `MEAN_REVERSION` |
| `EXPANSION` | `HIGH_VOLATILITY` |
| `CONTRACTION` | `LOW_ACTIVITY` |
| `TRANSITION` | `UNFAVORABLE` |

The mapping is total over all 8 `MarketRegime` values (2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1), and all six `StrategyEnvironment` values are reachable.

### 3.4 EntryGuidance
`IMMEDIATE`, `WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION`, `PULLBACK`, `BREAKOUT`, `NO_ENTRY_CONTEXT` — from `trend_assessment × volatility_risk` (the L5 Risk Matrix `volatility_risk.score` on the canonical `[0, 100]` scale). Ordered first-match rules:

**Wire values (PascalCase):** `Immediate` / `WaitForConfirmation` / `Pullback` / `Breakout` / `NoEntryContext`.

```
# Priority order (first match wins):
1. volatility_risk ≥ 60                                                → NO_ENTRY_CONTEXT
2. trend ∈ {STRONG, HEALTHY}  AND  volatility_risk < 40                → IMMEDIATE
3. trend ∈ {STRONG, HEALTHY}  AND  volatility_risk ∈ [40, 60)          → PULLBACK
4. trend = DEVELOPING  AND  volatility_risk < 20                       → BREAKOUT
5. trend = DEVELOPING                                                  → WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION
6. otherwise (trend ∈ {WEAK, EXHAUSTED, UNKNOWN})                      → NO_ENTRY_CONTEXT
```

The rules tile the input space with no gap or overlap: `volatility_risk ≥ 60` exits at rule 1; below that, `STRONG`/`HEALTHY` trends split on the `[40, 60)` boundary (rules 2–3) and `DEVELOPING` trends split on the `< 20` boundary (rules 4–5); every other trend assessment falls through to rule 6. All five `EntryGuidance` values are reachable. Canonical scenario (trend `HEALTHY`, `volatility_risk = 45`) → rule 3 → `PULLBACK`.

### 3.5 ExitGuidance
`TREND_WEAKENING`, `MOMENTUM_EXHAUSTION`, `STRUCTURE_BREAKDOWN`, `RISK_INCREASING`, `NO_WARNING` — from `momentum_assessment × structure_assessment × overall_risk`. Ordered first-match rules:

**Wire values (PascalCase):** `TrendWeakening` / `MomentumExhaustion` / `StructureBreakdown` / `RiskIncreasing` / `NoWarning`.

```
# Priority order (first match wins):
1. overall_risk ≥ 80                                       → RISK_INCREASING
2. structure ∈ {BROKEN, UNKNOWN}                           → STRUCTURE_BREAKDOWN
3. momentum = REVERSING                                    → MOMENTUM_EXHAUSTION
4. momentum = WEAKENING  OR  overall_risk ≥ 60             → TREND_WEAKENING
5. otherwise                                               → NO_WARNING
```

`structure_assessment` is a declared input: the previous `momentum × overall_risk` input set could never produce `STRUCTURE_BREAKDOWN`. All five `ExitGuidance` values are reachable. Canonical scenario (momentum `STABLE`, structure `HEALTHY`, `overall_risk = 28.3`) → rule 5 → `NO_WARNING`.

### 3.6 ProtectionStrategy (Dynamic Stops)
`STRUCTURE_BASED`, `VOLATILITY_BASED`, `ATR_BASED`, `SR_BASED`, `NO_RECOMMENDATION`.

**Wire values (PascalCase):** `StructureBased` / `VolatilityBased` / `ATRBased` / `SRBased` / `NoRecommendation`.

```
volatility_assessment = COMPRESSED                                              → STRUCTURE_BASED
VolatilityAssessment-risk score > 60  AND  volatility_assessment ∈ {EXPANDING, EXTREME} → VOLATILITY_BASED
market_regime = RANGE  AND  StructureAssessment ∈ {STRONG, HEALTHY}  AND  distance_to_nearest_SR < 0.5 · ATR → SR_BASED
no indicators available (empty state per §7)                                     → NO_RECOMMENDATION
otherwise                                                                       → ATR_BASED
```

All five `ProtectionStrategy` values are reachable from the documented rules. `STRUCTURE_BASED` consumes `volatility_assessment = COMPRESSED` (from `02-02-analysis-matrix.md §3.6`). `VOLATILITY_BASED` requires a high `volatility_risk` score (from the L5 Risk Matrix). `SR_BASED` requires range regime with healthy structure and proximity to a structural S/R level. `ATR_BASED` is the production default. `NO_RECOMMENDATION` is reached only on the empty-state fallback path (no indicators completed; see §7).

**`stop_loss_distance_pct` formula (canonical — NOT ATR-based).** The concrete stop distance is computed in `crates/core-domain/src/advisory.rs::compute_advisory` from the volatility-risk dimension and structure assessment, **not** from ATR or structural levels:

```
base_multiplier = 1.0  if structure_assessment ∈ {STRONG, HEALTHY}
                  1.5  otherwise
base_pct        = (base_multiplier × 2.0).clamp(0.5, 5.0)        // 2.0% or 3.0% base
risk_bump       = (risk.volatility_risk.score / 100.0) × 10.0   // 0–10% additive
stop_loss_distance_pct = (base_pct + risk_bump).clamp(0.5, 15.0) // percent
```

The structural multiplier does the heavy lifting (strong/healthy structure → 1× stop, weak structure → 1.5× stop); `volatility_risk` (an L5 0-100 risk score, not the underlying ATR) contributes the additive bump. The `[0.5, 15.0]` percent clamp is the canonical platform stop-distance band.

### 3.7 TargetStrategy (Target Zones)
`RESISTANCE_BASED`, `RR_BASED`, `VOLATILITY_BASED`, `TRAILING_METHOD`, `NO_RECOMMENDATION`.

**Wire values (PascalCase):** `ResistanceBased` / `RRBased` / `VolatilityBased` / `TrailingMethod` / `NoRecommendation`.

```
structure_assessment ∈ {STRONG, HEALTHY}      → RESISTANCE_BASED
L5 overall_risk.score < 40                    → RR_BASED
L5 overall_risk.score < 60                    → TRAILING_METHOD
no indicators available (empty state per §7)  → NO_RECOMMENDATION
otherwise                                     → VOLATILITY_BASED
```

All five `TargetStrategy` values are reachable from the documented rules. `RESISTANCE_BASED` consumes `structure_assessment ∈ {STRONG, HEALTHY}` (from `02-02-analysis-matrix.md §3.5`). `RR_BASED` / `TRAILING_METHOD` key on the **L5 overall-risk score** (the engine's ordering-first-match implementation in `core-domain/src/advisory.rs`; low risk = clean enough to commit to a fixed R:R target, moderate = trail the stop). `VOLATILITY_BASED` is the production default. `NO_RECOMMENDATION` is reached only on the empty-state fallback path (see §7).

### 3.8 `entry_danger` (Synoptic Danger)

`entry_danger` is a `RiskDimension` (score, level, state, confidence, evidence) — renamed from `risk_favorability` in v2.1 to disambiguate the semantic convention. The RiskDimension convention is that **high score = danger, low score = safe** (consistent with all other Risk Matrix dimensions).

> **`evidence` is not populated.** The backend constructs `entry_danger` via `RiskDimension::from_score_with_confidence`, which leaves `evidence` as an empty vector — the wire **omits** the `evidence` key entirely (`skip_serializing_if = "Vec::is_empty"`, matching the other Risk dimensions). The TypeScript type still declares `evidence: string[]` for legacy-payload compatibility; consumers must not expect the key on current payloads.

`entry_danger` synthesizes the **danger of entering a new position in the current interpretive state** by combining L3 `market_quality` and L4 `opportunity_score` — the two forward-looking signals most relevant to "is the environment dangerous for a new trade?".

```
# Base from market_quality (institutional bands):
#
#   | market_quality | quality_penalty |
#   |----------------|-----------------|
#   | EXCELLENT      | 10              |
#   | GOOD           | 25              |
#   | AVERAGE        | 50              |
#   | WEAK           | 70              |
#   | POOR           | 80              |

# Combine with opportunity_score (institutional 0–100):
score = mean(quality_penalty, 100 − opportunity_score)  // ∈ [0, 100]

# RiskLevel banding (aligned with Risk Matrix §2.3 — strict half-open intervals):
# EXTREME  = score ≥ 80
# HIGH     = score ∈ [60, 80)
# MODERATE = score ∈ [40, 60)
# LOW      = score ∈ [20, 40)
# VERY_LOW = score < 20
```

#### 3.8.1 RiskLevel Bands

```
score ≥ 80 → Extreme
score ≥ 60 → High
score ≥ 40 → Moderate
score ≥ 20 → Low
otherwise  → VeryLow
```

> **`entry_danger` band boundaries.** Bands are strict half-open intervals aligned with the canonical [Risk Matrix §2.3](./02-11-risk-matrix.md) `RiskLevel` enum (`EXTREME / HIGH / MODERATE / LOW / VERY_LOW`, thresholds `80 / 60 / 40 / 20`). Boundary values map to exactly one band. This unifies the cross-engine vocabulary so `entry_danger.level` and `risk.<dim>.level` share the same enum and the same numeric bands.

**Why this derivation:** `quality_penalty` reflects "how *poor* is the environment" (low = excellent conditions, high = dangerous conditions). `100 − opportunity_score` reflects "how *poor* is the absence of a setup" (low = great setup, high = no viable setup). Averaging the two gives a synoptic "how dangerous is it to enter here?" measure. This is the natural successor of the old `Risk.expected_rr` formula, with the addition of `opportunity_score` as an L4 input (legitimate L6 synthesis of state + forecast + danger).

## 4. Trade Readiness & Confidence

The Decision Matrix's headline confidence combines analysis conviction with risk discount:

$$\text{confidence\_assessment} = \text{clamp}\Big(\text{analysis.state\_confidence} \times \big(1 - \tfrac{\text{overall\_risk}}{100}\big) \times 100,\ 0,\ 100\Big)$$

Trade readiness is a function of this confidence, the directional guidance, the entry guidance, and `market_stance`. Ordered first-match rules (bounds in `[a, b)` notation):

```
# Priority order (first match wins):
1. market_stance = AVOID  OR  confidence < 20                            → STAND_ASIDE
2. non-neutral guidance AND confidence ≥ 60
   AND market_stance ∈ {AGGRESSIVE, CONSTRUCTIVE}
   AND entry_guidance ≠ WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION                            → READY
3. non-neutral guidance AND ≥1 qualifying profile (preconditions_met > 0,
   non-NoClear)                                                         → FORMING
4. otherwise                                                             → WATCH
```

> **Tiling proof (no gap, no overlap).** Under first-match ordering the five rules partition the full input space (`market_stance` × `confidence_assessment` × `directional_guidance` × `entry_guidance`):
> - Rule 1 absorbs every state with `market_stance = AVOID` or `confidence < 20`. The former overlap — `confidence ∈ [40, 60)` with `market_stance = AVOID` matching both `FORMING` and `STAND_ASIDE` — now resolves unambiguously to `STAND_ASIDE`.
> - Rules 2–3 partition the surviving non-neutral-guidance states: rule 2 takes the confirmed high-conviction subset (`confidence ≥ 60`, stance ∈ {AGGRESSIVE, CONSTRUCTIVE}, entry ≠ `WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION`) → `READY`; rule 3 takes every other non-neutral state → `FORMING`. This closes the former gap: `confidence ≥ 60` with stance `CAUTIOUS`/`NEUTRAL` and non-neutral guidance, and `entry_guidance = WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION` at any `confidence ≥ 20`, both now land in `FORMING`.
> - Rule 4 catches the entire remainder: any state reaching it has neutral guidance (non-neutral states were absorbed by rules 2–3) with `confidence ≥ 20` and `market_stance ≠ AVOID`, so the neutral-guidance disjunct alone suffices; the `confidence ∈ [20, 40)` disjunct is an explicit guard keeping the band visible. Rule 5 is a defensive default — unreachable under the current vocabulary — keeping the ruleset total if the guidance enums grow.

> **FORMING gate (v6.10.19 T4).** Rule 3 additionally requires at least one
> QUALIFYING profile — "FORMING" means a setup is actively coiling, so a
> dead no-clear market with a directional lean reads WATCH (the lean stays
> visible via the verdict decoupling; the readiness is honest).

> **Lean-floor transparency (v6.10.19 P6).** `DecisionContext.lean_floor_applied`
> is `true` whenever the graded-lean floors actually adjusted the split
> (HOLD capped at 60% and/or the directional arm raised to 15%) — the UI
> renders a LEAN annotation so the operator always knows a boosted
> low-confidence read from a deep consensus.

> **Readiness `entry_guidance` mirror (v6.10.17).** The `DecisionContext` `entry_guidance_is_wait` gate that blocks rule 2 now mirrors the FULL §3.4 entry-guidance derivation (advisory.rs) instead of the legacy volatility-only proxy: wait-states are `volatility_risk ≥ 60` (NoEntryContext), `Weak`/`Exhausted` trends (NoEntryContext), and `Developing` trends with `volatility_risk ≥ 20` (WaitForConfirmation). A READY badge can therefore never coexist with "Entry: Wait for confirmation" on the playbook.

> **Stance-vs-market-stance disambiguation.** The readiness rules reference `market_stance` (the L6 `MarketStance` 5-state enum: `AGGRESSIVE` / `CONSTRUCTIVE` / `NEUTRAL` / `CAUTIOUS` / `AVOID` — environmental aggressiveness assessment). They do **not** reference the per-symbol **execution stance** (`Stance` 3-state enum: `ACTIVE` / `CLOSE_ONLY` / `AVOID` — PME-managed execution authorization). See the Rust doc comment in `crates/config-models/src/models.rs::Stance` for the canonical disambiguation. The pre-trade gate in [08-02 Gate 1](../operations-and-compliance/08-02-pre-trade-risk-controls.md) already filters by execution stance before the readiness check.

## 5. Scenario Pathways & Invalidation

The Decision Matrix carries the structural invalidation and target context used by the TAE Position Sizing Protocol:

| Concept | Source | Consumer |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Stop-loss distance (`D_sl`, %)** | `stop_loss_distance_pct` (§3.6 — the volatility/structure-scaled percentage formula). | TAE Execution ($S = \frac{E \times R}{D_{sl} / 100}$). |
| **Target zone** | `target_strategy` applied to resistance / R:R / volatility. | TAE Execution, PME trailing. |
| **Invalidation level** (`invalidation_level`) | Structural level whose breach nullifies the thesis. | PME dynamic stop management. |

> **`invalidation_level` vs `stop_loss_distance_pct`.** Both fields govern stop distance but serve different roles: `invalidation_level` is an absolute **price level** from L4 — a structural point (Fibonacci Golden Pocket, S/R, trend line) whose breach nullifies the trade thesis (consumed by PME for dynamic stop trailing). `stop_loss_distance_pct` is a **percentage** from L6 — the §3.6 formula output (volatility-risk scaled, **not** ATR-based) that feeds the TAE Position Sizing Protocol as $D_{sl}$ (resolution priority: `fixed_stop_loss_pct` → `stop_loss_distance_pct` → system default `2.0`; see [TAE L2 §2](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-03-tae-layer2-execution.md)).
| **Bull / Bear scenario** | Conditional pathways described in `final_recommendation`. | Human operator / observability. |

**Self-consistency check** — Scenario B — perfect alignment (independent of the ontology §A-series) (the example values satisfy the §2.3 / §3.1 / §3.6 / §3.7 / §3.8 / §4 formulas):

> **Independent boundary example — not part of the canonical scenario chain (seed [02-01-alignment-matrix.md §6](../matrices/02-01-alignment-matrix.md)).**
- Analysis Matrix `state_confidence` = 1.0; Risk Matrix `overall_risk.score = 28.3` (matches the canonical Risk Matrix JSON example; expressed as a fraction, `0.283`).
- `confidence_assessment = clamp(1.0 × (1 − 0.283) × 100, 0, 100) = clamp(71.7, 0, 100) = 71.7` ✓
- `bias = STRONG_BULLISH` with `overall_risk = 28.3 < 50` ⇒ `directional_guidance = STRONG_LONG` per the §3.1 rule ✓
- `decision_context.score = 97.0` per the §2.3 confluence-score formula: with `alignment.tradability_dim = 100`, `analysis.market_quality_score = 100` (EXCELLENT → 100), and `opportunity.opportunity_score = 85`, the formula yields `0.50·100 + 0.30·100 + 0.20·85 = 97.0` ⇒ `score_confidence = |score| / 100 = 0.97` per the §2.2 mapping ✓
- `expected_reward_risk_ratio = (active-side R:R) × (1 − L5.overall_risk / 100) = 2.5 × (1 − 0.283) = 2.5 × 0.717 = 1.79` (using `L4.long_expected_rr_internal = 2.5` from the Opportunity Matrix example — active side for the bullish `STRONG_BULLISH` bias — and `L5.overall_risk.score = 28.3` on the canonical `[0, 100]` scale) ✓
- `quality_to_risk_ratio = market_quality_score ÷ overall_risk.score = 100 ÷ 28.3 ≈ 3.53` (v6.11 — the setup-efficiency KPI; `None` when the risk score is 0) ✓
- `entry_danger.score = mean(quality_penalty, 100 − opportunity_score) = mean(10, 100 − 85) = mean(10, 15) = 12.5` (with `market_quality = EXCELLENT` → `quality_penalty = 10` and `opportunity_score = 85`). Score `12.5` falls in the `VERY_LOW` band (`< 20` per the §3.8 half-open intervals); the `evidence` array is empty and omitted from the wire (§3.8) ✓
- `trade_readiness = READY` per the §4 ordered rules: rule 1 does not fire (`market_stance = CONSTRUCTIVE`, `confidence_assessment = 71.7 ≥ 20`); rule 2 fires — non-neutral guidance (`STRONG_LONG`), `71.7 ≥ 60`, `market_stance = CONSTRUCTIVE ∈ {AGGRESSIVE, CONSTRUCTIVE}`, `entry_guidance = IMMEDIATE ≠ WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION` ✓. `trade_readiness`, `entry_danger`, and `expected_reward_risk_ratio` are nested under `decision_context` on the wire (§2.2) ✓
- `stop_loss_distance_pct = 1.5` is the f64 type-boundary handoff to TAE (see §5 Scenario Pathways / `01-02-global-architecture.md §6.3`); TAE casts to Decimal at the execution boundary. (Note: the §3.6 formula yields `(1.0 × 2.0).clamp(0.5, 5.0) + (volatility_risk.score/100 × 10)` for strong structure — the worked `1.5` value is illustrative.)

> Scenario A (alignment score 40) is worked end-to-end in 01-01-ontology.md §A.2–A.6.

Enum values serialize as **PascalCase** on the wire (`"StrongLong"`, `"Constructive"`, `"VeryLow"`, `"StrongBullish"`, …); the SCREAMING_SNAKE forms in the prose above are the `Display` vocabulary. Two exceptions: `trade_readiness` is a plain `String` carrying `"READY"` / `"FORMING"` / `"WATCH"` / `"STAND_ASIDE"`, and `DecisionContext.bias` is a `String` carrying the PascalCase `MarketBias` values (`"StrongBullish"`).

## 7. Empty State

When `analysis.timeframes_considered == 0`, `compute_advisory` returns `AdvisoryMatrix::empty()`: `directional_guidance = NEUTRAL`, `market_stance = NEUTRAL`, `confidence_assessment = 0.0`, recommendation `"Insufficient data to provide guidance."`.

## 8. Design Guarantees

| Property | Guarantee |
|----------|-----------|
| **No autonomous execution** | The Decision Matrix recommends; it never places orders. Execution is the TAE's responsibility. |
| **Explainability** | `final_recommendation` and `contributing_indicators` trace every recommendation to its evidence. |
| **Risk-discounted confidence** | Confidence is always attenuated by overall risk. |
| **Stable contract** | The TAE Policy Layer depends only on these public fields, not on internal derivation. |
