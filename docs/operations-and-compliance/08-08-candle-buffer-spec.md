## §1 Purpose

This document is the **single source of truth** for the platform's candle buffer behavior across all exchanges and the fixed-ladder slots (`micro1`…`longterm2`; v11.1 pool — v11.2 runs its fastest `[workspace].active_timeframes` slots, the rest are inert). The candle universe is governed by **three independent numbers** — each with its own role, never interchangeable:

| Tier | Value | Constant / config | Role |
|------|-------|-------------------|------|
| Indicator minimum | **300** | `INDICATORS_MAX_BARS_REQUIRED` (`market-analyzer/src/indicators/registry.rs`) | The minimum bars every indicator needs to be mathematically correct (`bars_required`); carried by the L1 `price_trend_sharpe` window. |
| Warmup | **500** | `[candle_buffer] size` (`config.toml`, default in `config-models`) | The historical warmup depth: how many candles a ≥ 1-minute pipeline fetches from the exchange REST endpoint at bootstrap (CB-08). |
| Absolute maximum | **1000** | `HIST_BUFFER_MAX` (`market-analyzer/src/analyzer/warm.rs`) | The hard in-memory cap — there are **never more than 1000 candles**, sub-minute and above-minute, **same behavior**. Enforced by `trim_snapshot_history_to_cap` and the `/api/history` 1000-candle contract. |

*(Before this document existed the corpus conflated the three into competing buffer sizes — the legacy `analysis_limit = 1000` config default, the `HIST_BUFFER_MAX = 1000` cap, and the UI selector cap `500` — and per-exchange REST behavior diverged: Hyperliquid sent no `limit` parameter at all; Bitget hardcoded `limit=200` with no pagination; both exchanges silently coerced sub-minute durations to `"1m"` and warmed sub-minute pipelines with 60-second candles.)*

The platform now has one canonical behavior per tier. Every exchange, every timeframe, every session runs the same algorithm against the same constants; the only inputs that vary are the configured `[candle_buffer] size` and the configured `timeframe_secs` of each pipeline.

## §2 Frozen decisions (CB-01 … CB-12)

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| **CB-01** | The canonical candle-buffer size — the **historical warmup depth** — is configured by **`[candle_buffer] size`** in `config.toml`. The default value is **500**. It is one of three independent candle numbers: `INDICATORS_MAX_BARS_REQUIRED = 300` (indicator calculation floor), this `size` (500, the internet warmup), and `HIST_BUFFER_MAX = 1000` (absolute in-memory cap, sub-minute and above-minute, same behavior). The previous `analysis_limit` field is **removed**; the historical lookback depth equals the buffer size. |
| **CB-02** | Every per-timeframe in-memory buffer (`NormalizedCandle` history, `MarketSnapshot` history, indicator warm-up buffers) is rolled at `candle_buffer.size` entries; the absolute in-memory cap is `HIST_BUFFER_MAX = 1000` (`warm.rs`, CB-01). Steady-state memory per pipeline is therefore `2 × size` rows of OHLCV + size snapshots. |
| **CB-03** | The rolling window is **FIFO oldest-evict**. On every completed candle the pipeline pushes the new candle at the back and pops the oldest from the front, keeping the deque at exactly `size`. There is no grow-then-trim mode — the deque never exceeds the `HIST_BUFFER_MAX = 1000` absolute cap (CB-01). |
| **CB-04** | The **sub-minute / ≥ 1 minute** behavior split is binary on `timeframe_secs`: any duration strictly below 60 seconds follows CB-05–CB-07; any duration of 60 seconds or more follows CB-08–CB-10. There is no third branch. |
| **CB-05** | **Sub-minute timeframes (`timeframe_secs < 60`) state-replay warmup (PRI-03, v6.10.7).** By default (`sub_minute_skip_historical = false`) the bootstrap replays REAL 60 s REST closes through the sub-minute pipeline's indicator state machines; `bar_count`/`real_bar_count` inherit the warmed length. The replayed bars never enter `snapshot_history` (PRI-08) and — since AUDIT-AIU-117 — do **not** seed the slot's `history` deque either (they are 12× too wide for the slot's structural indicators); `history` fills from live candles. With `sub_minute_skip_historical = true`, the slot starts at **zero entries** and grows one candle at a time as live trades close their buckets. Persisted SYNTHETIC rows are excluded from the warm replay on restart (AUDIT-AIU-118). |
| **CB-05a** | **(AUDIT-V8-003 idle-bucket heartbeat)** When a sub-minute pipeline has **no current candle** (the market is quiet after a close) and wall-clock has advanced past ≥ 1 bucket since the last completed bucket, the stale check synthesizes one doji per elapsed empty bucket at the last known close (`reconstructed: SYNTHETIC`, O=H=L=C=last close, zero volume), feeds it through every stateful indicator, broadcasts it, and pushes it into the in-memory `snapshot_history` **and persists it to SQLite** (K3 — restart continuity for `/api/history`; AUDIT-AIU-118 keeps persisted SYNTHETIC rows out of warm state). The chart therefore shows one closed candle per wall-clock bucket even with zero trades — no gaps, no frontend flat-Doji bridges, no straight-line EMA segments. |
| **CB-06** | While a sub-minute pipeline is warming up, **every one of the 52 indicators is in `IndicatorLifecycleState::Loading`** until its individual `bars_required` is met. The pipeline transitions to `CandlePipelineState::Live` when the buffer reaches **`max(candle_buffer.size / 10, 50)` real-or-total bars** (PRI-05; a warmed sub-minute slot is Live at its first live close). Reconstructed candles from `[08-04]` and idle-bucket dojis count toward the pipeline `bar_count` but are **not enough on their own to promote `Loading → Live`** — the per-indicator gate requires `bars_required` of **true live** candles (`bars_seen_real`, AUDIT-AIU-120), so a doji-only quiet market keeps indicators in `Loading` until genuine closes accumulate. *(AUDIT-V8-001: `ema_stack` carries `bars_required = 1`; its ribbon lines are gated per-period inside `inject_ema_values` — see [04-02-01](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/indicators/04-02-01-ema-stack.md) §Sub-minute warm-up.)* |
| **CB-07** | A **cold** sub-minute pipeline (no warm state) therefore needs roughly `max(size/10, 50) × timeframe_secs` of wall-clock time to reach `Live` (50 × 15 s ≈ 12.5 minutes for a 15-second micro TF); a warm-started one reaches `Live` at its first live close. The UI surfaces the loading progress via `tf.pipeline_state = LOADING` and per-indicator badges. *(The legacy "500 × 15 s = 125 minutes" figure assumed a 500-bar Live floor that was retired in v6.10.7.)* |
| **CB-08** | **≥ 1 minute timeframes (`timeframe_secs ≥ 60`) always start with exactly `candle_buffer.size` historical candles.** The platform paginates the exchange REST endpoint until either `size` candles are returned or the exchange's earliest available history is reached, then merges with the SQLite `market_snapshots` cache (newest DB takes precedence on overlap), then caps at `size`. |
| **CB-09** | A ≥ 1 minute cold start always completes with **all 52 indicators in `IndicatorLifecycleState::Live`** (every indicator's `bars_required ≤ INDICATORS_MAX_BARS_REQUIRED = 300 ≤ size = 500`). The user sees a chart with full history on first paint; the only visible loading state is the brief exchange-REST round-trip. |
| **CB-10** | Per-exchange REST pagination is the responsibility of the `HistoricalFetchPolicy` trait ([03-01-07](../engines/data-infrastructure-engine/03-01-07-die-historical-fetch-policy.md)). Bitget must paginate against its 200-row limit until `size` rows are returned; Hyperliquid must paginate against its implicit return-size cap using backward `startTime` cursors. Both adapters **must converge to exactly `size`** rows from a cold start whenever the exchange has sufficient history. |
| **CB-11** | A **single-slot reload** request (`POST /api/instances/:id/reload?slot=<name>`, one of `micro1`…`longterm2`; since v11.1 slot durations are fixed, so the API serves operational recovery — stuck pipeline, warm-handover shortfall — not duration edits) triggers a **single-TF reload** of only the affected pipeline via the `reload_timeframe` API (`portfolio-supervisor`). The other nine pipelines continue uninterrupted. The reload tears down the affected `TimeframePipeline`, re-runs bootstrap against its fixed `timeframe_secs`, and re-emits `INITIALIZING → LOADING → LIVE` on the new pipeline. |
| **CB-12** | SQLite retains its existing **7-day** retention policy unchanged. The `market_snapshots` table is the long-term log; the in-memory `candle_buffer.size` rolling window is the only thing bounded by `size`. On eviction the candle leaves memory; the corresponding SQLite row remains queryable until the 7-day cleanup deletes it. |

## §3 Configuration schema

```toml
# config.toml — single source of truth for candle buffer behavior
[candle_buffer]
size = 500                                # historical warmup depth (CB-01)
stale_threshold_secs = 300                # CB-06/§4 stale-loading escalation
sub_minute_skip_historical = false        # CB-05 / PRI-03 (v6.10.7): default is FALSE — sub-minute tiers state-replay warmup from the DB instead of booting empty; set true only for legacy "empty buffer" behaviour
```

Per-instance `analysis_limit` blocks and the `analysis_limit` field on `TimeframeConfig` are **removed**. Any leftover value in `config.toml` after the migration is logged as a warning and ignored.

## §4 Behavior matrix

| `timeframe_secs` | Cold-start candles in buffer | State on cold start | Earliest `Live` | Historical source |
|-----------------:|-----------------------------:|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `< 60` (sub-min) | 0 cold / warmed state replay (PRI-03) | `LOADING` | Cold: ~`max(size/10, 50) × timeframe_secs`; warm-started: first live close (PRI-05) | 60 s REST state replay (CB-05); quiet buckets filled by the idle-bucket heartbeat (CB-05a) |
| `≥ 60`           | exactly `size`               | `LIVE`              | Immediately after REST/DB merge | Exchange REST paginated to `size` + SQLite merge (CB-08) |
| `≥ 60` (already-warm DB) | ≤ `size`, oldest-first | `LIVE`              | Immediately | SQLite (newest), forward REST gap fill if any |

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Live completed candle | Push back; if buffer length would exceed `size`, pop front (CB-03) |
| Reconstructed candle (gap fill) | Push back; pop front; increment indicator `bars_seen` but does **not** promote `Loading → Live` on its own (CB-06) |
| Operator TF change | Tear down + rebuild only that TF via `reload_timeframe` (CB-11) |
| Operator full restart | All 10 ladder slots rebuild from cold via CB-05/CB-08 rules |
| Connection loss + reconnect | Reconstruction path per `[08-04]`; pipeline remains in its current state |
| Indicator `bars_seen ≥ bars_required` and parent TF = `LIVE` | Indicator transitions `Loading → Live` ([03-02-15](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-15-mme-indicator-lifecycle-states.md)) |
| `(now - last_updated_at) > stale_threshold_secs` and `bars_seen < bars_required` | Indicator transitions `Loading → Failed`; TF follows (CB-06, see [03-01-06 §4](../engines/data-infrastructure-engine/03-01-06-die-candle-pipeline-states.md)) |

## §5 Reload triggers

The `reload_timeframe` API is the canonical entry point for all in-place changes that affect a single TF pipeline. Triggers:

| Trigger | Reload scope | Pipeline state after reload |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Operator invokes `/api/instances/:id/reload?slot=<name>` (one of `micro1|micro2|fast1|fast2|slow1|slow2|macro1|macro2|longterm1|longterm2`) | that slot only | `INITIALIZING → LOADING → LIVE` (CB-11) |
| Operator invokes `/api/instances/:id/reload?slot=all` | every ACTIVE ladder slot (v11.2) | each follows the above |
| Boot-time instance spawn | every ACTIVE ladder slot (v11.2 — the fastest-N prefix) | `INITIALIZING → LOADING → LIVE` per CB-05/CB-08 |
| Recharge (existing API) | every ACTIVE ladder slot (v11.2) | same |

Slot durations are fixed (v11.1) — there is no operator duration edit that would force a reload; the API remains for operational recovery (stuck pipeline, warm-handover shortfall).

Other reload triggers (clock-drift panic, exchange key rotation) continue to follow their existing per-trigger paths.

## §6 Interaction with existing systems

| System | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| `ConnectionStatus` (`03-01-01 §4.2`) | Independent. A `Failed` `ConnectionStatus` over the supervisor-level threshold escalates the parent `TimeframePipeline` to `Failed` via [03-01-06 §3](../engines/data-infrastructure-engine/03-01-06-die-candle-pipeline-states.md). |
| `ReconnectState` (`08-03`) | Independent. Reconnects do not reload the candle buffer; they trigger reconstruction (CB-12 + `[08-04]`). |
| `LifecycleState` (`03-03-06`) | Independent. A `STOPPED` instance halts the event loop but keeps the buffer readable; a `RUNNING → STOPPED` transition does not flush history. |
| SQLite `market_snapshots` (`06-02`) | The 7-day retention policy is unchanged. Bootstrap reads SQLite newest-first; live candles append; cleanup deletes rows older than 7 days. The in-memory `size` cap is unrelated. |
| `MarketContext` ([03-02-02 §6](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-02-mme-layer1-metrics.md)) | Continues to be computed once the pipeline is `Live`; while `Loading` it emits neutral values explicitly tagged `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` per the indicator-lifecycle spec. |
| UI `analysisLimit` selector | Removed. The UI selector now exposes only `[candle_buffer] size` from the config API. |

## §7 Implementation work items

Tracked in `docs/CHANGELOG.md §Open Items` with `AUDIT-V7-NN` identifiers.

- `AUDIT-V7-300` — `config-models`: introduce `CandleBufferConfig` struct + `[candle_buffer]` block; remove `analysis_limit` from `TimeframeConfig`; add migration log line for legacy `analysis_limit` keys.
- `AUDIT-V7-301` — `core-domain`: introduce `CandlePipelineState`, `IndicatorLifecycleState`, `IndicatorLifecycleStatus` (see [03-01-06](../engines/data-infrastructure-engine/03-01-06-die-candle-pipeline-states.md) §2 and [03-02-15](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-15-mme-indicator-lifecycle-states.md) §2).
- `AUDIT-V7-302` — `network-adapters`: introduce `HistoricalFetchPolicy` trait; implement `HyperliquidHistoricalFetch` (paginated backward cursor); implement `BitgetHistoricalFetch` (paginated forward cursor with `limit=200` per page).
- `AUDIT-V7-303` — `market-analyzer`: replace `HIST_BUFFER_MAX = 1000` with `candle_buffer.size`; ensure deque never exceeds `size`; populate `IndicatorLifecycleStatus` for all 50 registry entries; publish `tf.pipeline_state`.
- `AUDIT-V7-304` — `portfolio-supervisor`: rewrite `collect_candles` to use `HistoricalFetchPolicy`; sub-minute returns empty Vec; ≥ 1 minute paginates until `size` then merges DB; expose `reload_timeframe(instance_id, slot, new_config)` API.
- `AUDIT-V7-305` — `api-gateway`: add `POST /api/instances/:instance_id/reload?slot=`; extend `/api/history` clamp to `candle_buffer.size`; add `pipeline_state` + `indicator_lifecycle` to the `/api/history` response.
- `AUDIT-V7-306` — `execution-daemon`: fix `--web` boot so `init_session` does not deactivate before auto-spawning configured instances (currently `main.rs:261` sets `active = false` immediately).
- `AUDIT-V7-307` — `ui`: introduce `IndicatorStatusBadge.svelte`; honor `tf.pipeline_state` in chart headers; stop merging old values when a snapshot arrives with `pipeline_state = LOADING`; remove the `analysisLimit` selector (replace with read-only display of `candle_buffer.size`).
