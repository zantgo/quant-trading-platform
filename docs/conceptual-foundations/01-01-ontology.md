# Trading Platform Ontology

**Version:** 11.6 (2026-09-16) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.

## Chapter 1 — Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
This document establishes the definitive, formal ontology for the Trading Platform (v2). It serves as the single source of truth for all terminology, conceptual models, system boundaries, and architectural definitions across the entire software suite. 

By defining a precise, unambiguous vocabulary, this ontology ensures conceptual alignment across all development phases, architectural specifications, database schemas, API contracts, and user interface designs.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this ontology encompasses the entire lifecycle of quantitative and automated trading activities, structured across five specialized, independent business domains:
1. **Data Acquisition and Standardization** (Data Infrastructure Engine)
2. **Market Observation and Intelligence** (Market Monitoring Engine)
3. **Execution Policy and Order Management** (Trade Automation Engine)
4. **Active Exposure and Capital Supervision** (Portfolio Management Engine)
5. **Historical Performance and Strategy Evaluation** (Performance Analytics Engine)

---

## Chapter 2 — Design Philosophy

The Trading Platform is founded on a set of architectural and conceptual principles that define how the system is organized, how information is transformed, and how responsibilities are distributed. These principles are independent of any programming language, implementation, or trading strategy. They represent the permanent design philosophy of the platform and guide every architectural decision.

### 2.1 Purpose
The purpose of the design philosophy is to establish a consistent framework for building, extending, and maintaining the Trading Platform. Rather than solving isolated technical problems, every component of the platform must follow the same conceptual principles. This ensures that the platform remains:
*   Consistent
*   Modular
*   Explainable
*   Predictable
*   Extensible
*   Maintainable

As the platform evolves, new functionality must integrate naturally into the existing conceptual model rather than introducing competing design patterns.

### 2.2 Single Responsibility
Every conceptual component of the platform exists for exactly one purpose. Responsibilities are never duplicated across multiple components. Each responsibility belongs to a single architectural location. 
*   The Data Infrastructure Engine acquires and prepares data.
*   The Market Monitoring Engine understands and interprets the market.
*   The Trade Automation Engine executes configured policies.
*   The Portfolio Management Engine supervises active positions and capital.
*   The Performance Analytics Engine evaluates historical results.

The same principle applies within every engine: each layer performs one analytical transformation, and each matrix represents one analytical output. This separation minimizes coupling and maximizes clarity.

### 2.3 Progressive Abstraction
The platform transforms information through successive levels of abstraction. Each stage adds business meaning and analytical value without discarding the integrity of preceding information. Raw market data gradually becomes structured intelligence. 

Conceptually, the transformation follows this progression:
$$\text{Raw Data} \longrightarrow \text{Observation} \longrightarrow \text{Correlation} \longrightarrow \text{Interpretation} \longrightarrow \text{Opportunity} \longrightarrow \text{Risk} \longrightarrow \text{Decision Support} \longrightarrow \text{Execution Action} \longrightarrow \text{Portfolio State} \longrightarrow \text{Performance Intelligence}$$

Every stage consumes structured information from the previous stage and produces a higher level of understanding. No stage should bypass another.

### 2.4 Hierarchical Organization
The Trading Platform follows a hierarchical conceptual organization. Higher-level concepts coordinate lower-level concepts without replacing their responsibilities. The hierarchy is:
$$\text{Trading Platform} \longrightarrow \text{Engine} \longrightarrow \text{Layer} \longrightarrow \text{Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Entity} \longrightarrow \text{Feature}$$

*   The **Trading Platform** defines the complete system.
*   An **Engine** owns a business domain.
*   A **Layer** owns an analytical stage.
*   A **Matrix** represents the structured output of that stage.

This hierarchy is applied consistently throughout all technical layers of the platform.

### 2.5 Separation of Concerns
Different business domains remain independent. Market analysis must not execute trades. Trade execution must not calculate indicators or drawdowns. Portfolio management must not interpret market trend bias. Performance analytics must not influence active portfolio risk. Each engine specializes in one domain and communicates only through well-defined, published outputs. This separation reduces complexity while allowing each domain to evolve independently.

### 2.6 Explainability
Every conclusion produced by the platform must be explainable and traceable. The platform must never produce a recommendation, execution command, or risk assessment that cannot be traced back to its supporting evidence. Every high-level decision possesses a complete chain of supporting data:
$$\text{Market Data} \longrightarrow \text{Indicators} \longrightarrow \text{Signals} \longrightarrow \text{Features} \longrightarrow \text{Alignment} \longrightarrow \text{Analysis} \longrightarrow \text{Opportunity/Risk} \longrightarrow \text{Decision Support} \longrightarrow \text{Policy Trigger} \longrightarrow \text{Execution}$$

Explainability is a core design goal of the platform, enabling systematic debugging and historical auditability.

### 2.7 Deterministic Behavior
The platform is designed to behave deterministically. Given identical inputs, the platform must produce identical outputs. Analytical components must avoid hidden states, undefined behavior, or non-reproducible processes. Deterministic behavior provides predictability, testability, and reliability, which are essential for quantitative trading systems.

### 2.8 Composability
Complex behavior emerges from the composition of simple, specialized components. Rather than building large, monolithic processing systems, the platform combines small analytical stages into complete pipelines. Each matrix represents a reusable analytical component; each layer composes multiple concepts into a higher-level representation; and each engine composes multiple layers into a complete business capability.

### 2.9 Encapsulation
Every engine encapsulates its internal implementation. External systems interact only through stable API boundaries. Consumers understand what an engine provides, what information it consumes, and what information it produces, but they do not depend on internal algorithms, localized data structures, or specific library implementations. This allows engines to be upgraded internally without affecting the rest of the platform.

### 2.10 Contract-Based Communication
Information flows between components through structured contracts. Within an engine, each layer communicates through its Matrix. Between engines, communication occurs through stable API contracts:
$$\text{Layer} \longrightarrow \text{Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Engine API} \longrightarrow \text{Next Engine}$$

This ensures that every analytical transformation has a clearly defined input and output, establishing a shared language across independent components.

### 2.11 Strategy-Agnostic Design
The platform is designed to describe and interpret markets objectively rather than to enforce a single trading methodology. No engine assumes trend-following, mean-reversion, breakout, scalping, or arbitrage logic natively within its telemetry or interpretation layers. Instead, the platform produces structured analytical data that can support many different trading strategies. Trading strategies are external consumers of market intelligence rather than part of the conceptual model itself.

### 2.12 Human-Centered Intelligence
The primary objective of the platform is to produce high-quality, interpretable market intelligence. While the system supports full automation, its analytical outputs are structured to be easily understood by human operators. Every decision vector, risk evaluation, and position state must remain interpretable, ensuring that automation enhances decision-making rather than obscuring it.

### 2.13 Configurable Automation
Automation is intentionally decoupled from market intelligence. The Market Monitoring Engine identifies and evaluates market states, opportunities, and risks. The Trade Automation Engine decides whether those environmental parameters satisfy user-defined execution policies. This separation allows identical market intelligence to support completely different execution behaviors depending on user preferences.

### 2.14 Scalability
The conceptual model is designed for continuous expansion. Future additions—such as new indicators, asset classes, execution venues, portfolio optimization algorithms, or performance metrics—must integrate naturally without requiring structural revisions to the platform's ontology.

### 2.15 Consistency
Concepts must retain the exact same meaning throughout the platform. An Engine always represents a business domain; a Layer always represents an analytical stage; a Matrix always represents a structured analytical output. Terminology is never modified depending on context, reducing ambiguity across documentation, implementation, and user interfaces.

### 2.16 Long-Term Evolution
Architectural decisions prioritize long-term maintainability, reliability, and logical consistency over short-term implementation convenience. The conceptual model remains stable while implementations improve over time.

## Chapter 3 — Core Concepts

The Trading Platform is built upon a small set of fundamental concepts that define every component of the system. These concepts form the common language used throughout the architecture, ontology, implementation, documentation, and user interface.

### 3.1 Trading Platform
The Trading Platform is the complete, integrated software system. It unifies every engine into a single quantitative trading environment. The platform is responsible for the complete lifecycle of trading activities, from raw data acquisition to long-term performance analytics.

### 3.2 Engine
An Engine is the largest independent functional unit within the platform. Each engine owns one business domain and is completely responsible for solving one category of problems. Engines expose their capabilities through stable APIs and communicate through immutable matrix contracts.

### 3.3 Layer
A Layer is a sequential analytical stage within an engine. Layers divide a complex business process into smaller, manageable steps. A layer consumes structured input, performs one transformation, and produces one structured output (its Matrix). Layers are executed hierarchically, with each layer increasing the level of abstraction.

### 3.4 Matrix
A Matrix is the formal, immutable output produced by a layer. It represents the data contract between analytical stages. A Matrix defines required inputs, processing boundaries, produced outputs, and quality guarantees, describing mathematical knowledge rather than programmatic implementation.

### 3.5 Entity
An Entity represents the object being analyzed. Within the Trading Platform, the primary entity is a financial instrument (e.g., `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `EURUSD`, `AAPL`). An entity provides the baseline context for every analytical process.

### 3.6 Market Instance
A Market Instance represents one monitored entity at one specific venue.

$$\text{Market Instance} = \text{(symbol, exchange)}$$

A Market Instance is a container owning the ACTIVE TimeframePipelines — one per slot of the fixed ladder pool (`micro1`…`longterm2`, 1 s–1 h; v11.1 fixed the pool, v11.2 runs its fastest `[workspace].active_timeframes` slots, 1..=10 default 5) — plus trading state, safety manager, and config. The per-(symbol, timeframe) analytical unit is the TimeframePipeline, the smallest operational unit of the MME.

### 3.7 Timeframe
A Timeframe defines the temporal resolution used to analyze an entity. Timeframes are the fixed, ordered 10-slot ladder (`micro1`, `micro2`, `fast1`, `fast2`, `slow1`, `slow2`, `macro1`, `macro2`, `longterm1`, `longterm2` — 1 s → 1 h; not operator-configurable) that together produce multi-timeframe intelligence.

### 3.8 Indicator
An Indicator is a continuous quantitative measurement derived from market data. Rather than returning a single numeric value, an indicator is represented as a structured telemetry object projected across multiple **Indicator Evaluation Axes** to provide immediate mathematical and behavioral context.

> **Target Architecture (Not Yet Implemented).** On the planned Data-Oriented hot path (DIE ingestion + MME Layers 1–5), indicators are computed with fast floating-point primitives (`f64`/`f32`) packed contiguously in memory (Structure of Arrays), enabling SIMD auto-vectorization, and are converted to exact decimals (`rust_decimal::Decimal`) only when crossing the transactional execution boundary (MME Layer 6 → TAE). *Current implementation:* most indicator calculators compute in `rust_decimal::Decimal` over `VecDeque` rolling windows (`crates/market-analyzer/src/indicators/*.rs`), with `f64` used at the normalization/synthesis stage.

### 3.9 Signal
A Signal is a discrete technical event detected from market telemetry. Rather than returning a binary state, a signal is represented as a structured telemetry object projected across multiple **Signal Evaluation Axes** to supply structural, risk-based, and transactional context.

> **Target Architecture (Not Yet Implemented).** Like indicators, signals on the target hot path are detected over contiguous `f64` primitive arrays and only lifted to `Decimal` at the execution boundary. *Current implementation:* signals are emitted as nested `IndicatorSignal` objects within the `Decimal`/`HashMap`-based `MarketSnapshot`.

### 3.9.1 Analytical Input Universe
The **Analytical Input Universe** is the collective term for everything emitted into the `MarketSnapshot` (Metrics Matrix envelope) that MME Layers 2–7 consume. It groups three sub-streams under one umbrella so subsequent specifications can refer to "the universe" without enumerating the parts:

1. **Indicators** — the registry-listed continuous quantitative measurements (§3.8). 51 entries as of v6.6+ (51, not the legacy 50, because `mark_index_spread` gained a registry entry in v6.6; see Appendix B §B.1 and the registry-verified count in `DOCS-CONSISTENCY-MANIFEST.md §12.2`).
2. **Signals** — discrete technical events (§3.9), in two sub-bands:
    - *Indicator signals* — `IndicatorSignal`s nested on a parent's `signals` array (per §3.9 contract).
    - *Liquidity signals* — the 11 `LiquiditySignalKind` variants emitted in `liquidity_signals` (`CascadeDetected` … `OiPriceDivergence`). Live in the same envelope, but on a separate array because they are derived from the L2.5 liquidity synthesis, not from a candle-based oscillator.
3. **Telemetry data sub-objects** — non-indicator, non-signal data attached to the envelope: `liquidity` (`LiquidityFlow`), `cluster` (`LiquidationClusterMatrix`), plus the L1.5 derivatives/orderbook feeds (`funding_rate`, `open_interest`, `oi_delta_1h`, `mark_price`, `index_price`, `book_depth`).

> **Boundary.** "Analytical Input Universe" is a *vocabulary* term. No Rust struct, registry entry, or serialized field is named that — the existing `MarketSnapshot` envelope remains the storage form. It exists so the rest of the corpus (and downstream engines) can refer to "everything L1 carries" in one phrase. The two categories of "first-class analytical entities" keep their exact §3.8 / §3.9 meanings inside the universe; signals + indicators are still distinct concepts. Telemetry data sub-objects are *data carriers*, not entities.

> **Cross-references.** Usage examples: [02-07-metrics-matrix.md §1](../matrices/02-07-metrics-matrix.md), [02-07-metrics-matrix.md §2.1.1](../matrices/02-07-metrics-matrix.md) (single-source-of-truth contract), [03-02-11 liquidity extension](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-11-mme-liquidity-extension.md), [04-02-00 indicator index](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/indicators/04-02-00-indicator-index.md).

### 3.10 Evaluation Axis
An Evaluation Axis is a standardized analytical dimension used to contextualize an indicator or signal. Projecting flat telemetry onto multiple axes transforms raw measurements into high-fidelity, multidimensional features, separating the raw value from its strength, direction, environmental context, and reliability.

#### 3.10.1  Evaluation Axes for Indicators
*   **Value:** The raw, quantitative numerical output of the mathematical formula (e.g., RSI = 68.4, ATR = 125).
*   **State:** The qualitative interpretation of the raw value (e.g., Bullish, Bearish, Neutral).
*   **Direction:** The immediate directional trajectory of the indicator's value vector (e.g., Rising, Falling, Flat).
*   **Strength:** The intensity or magnitude of the current reading relative to historical boundaries (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong, Extreme).
*   **Market Regime:** The environmental context under which the indicator is evaluated (e.g., Trending, Ranging, Expansion, Compression). Indicators are interpreted differently depending on this active state.
*   **Confidence:** The estimated mathematical reliability of the current reading, expressed as a probability ∈ [0, 1] (canonical confidence hierarchy: [02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md](../matrices/02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md)).
*   **Freshness:** The temporal decay state of the evaluation, measuring how recently the current reading was established (e.g., New, Recent, Old, Expired).
*   **Quality:** An audit of the indicator's signal-to-noise ratio, assessing whether the telemetry is clean or structurally distorted (e.g., Healthy, Noisy, Weak, Exceptional).

#### 3.10.2 Evaluation Axes for Signals
*   **Signal Type:** The specific technical event or pattern classification detected (e.g., Bullish Divergence, EMA Crossover).
*   **Direction:** The directional bias implied by the triggered event (e.g., Bullish, Bearish).
*   **Strength:** The qualitative weight or intensity of the signal trigger (e.g., Weak, Medium, Strong).
*   **Confidence:** The historical or statistical probability score associated with the trigger's reliability, ∈ [0, 1] (canonical confidence hierarchy: [02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md](../matrices/02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md)).
*   **Freshness:** The chronological distance (measured in elapsed intervals or candles) since the signal triggered (e.g., Just Triggered, 3 candles ago, Expired).
*   **Confirmation:** The validation state of the event, indicating whether supporting conditions have validated the trigger (e.g., `Potential`, `Confirmed`, `Active`). `Potential` indicates the geometry is present but unconfirmed (secondary confluence only); `Confirmed` means the confirming condition has fired (full scoring weight); `Active` indicates a confirmed **stateful** signal persisting over subsequent bars and tracked via `age_bars`. Momentary kinds never enter `Active`.
*   **Market Regime:** The macro regime context in which the signal occurred, determining its localized baseline reliability (e.g., `TRENDING_BULL`, `TRENDING_BEAR`, `RANGE`).
*   **Multi-Timeframe Agreement:** A boolean matrix mapping horizontal consensus across the fixed ladder's time horizons (`micro1`…`longterm2`).
*   **Risk:** The localized threat classification associated with entering a trade on this specific trigger (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
*   **Priority:** The structural execution urgency assigned to the event (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).

### 3.11 Local Confluence
Local Confluence measures the degree of mathematical agreement among indicators, signals, and analytical features within a single timeframe. It represents single-timeframe consensus. Multi-timeframe confluence is measured by the Alignment Layer's Confluence Matrix (see §6.2).

### 3.12 Alignment
Alignment measures the degree of agreement regarding market direction or structure among multiple timeframes of the same entity. Alignment answers the question: *Do multiple timeframes describe the same market condition?*

### 3.13 Analysis
Analysis represents the structural and behavioral diagnosis of observed market behavior. It synthesizes alignment and timeframe metrics to determine the dominant directional bias—represented qualitatively as a categorical classification and quantitatively as a continuous **Market Bias Score** normalized between `-1.0` (absolute bearish) and `+1.0` (absolute bullish)—as well as the market regime, active cycle phase, and trend quality.

### 3.14 Opportunity
Opportunity represents the **forecast** identified within the current market conditions. It evaluates whether favorable trading setups exist (e.g., Trend Continuation, Breakout, Pullback) and scores them from 0 to 100, independent of actual execution parameters. The canonical `OpportunityType` enum (eight variants — see [02-08-opportunity-matrix.md §3](../matrices/02-08-opportunity-matrix.md)) is owned by the Opportunity Matrix (L4); the Analysis Matrix's former `opportunity_analysis` field has been removed. The Opportunity Matrix's full schema (including the institutional fields `entry_zone`, `target_zone`, `invalidation_level`, `long_/short_expected_rr_internal`, and `time_horizon`) is documented in [02-08-opportunity-matrix.md §2](../matrices/02-08-opportunity-matrix.md); this §3.14 entry is the conceptual definition only. The legacy matrix-level `expected_rr_internal` was removed in v6.9.

### 3.15 Risk
Risk represents the structural, technical, and environmental dangers present in the current market, independent of directional bias. It scores threats (volatility risk, **execution_liquidity_risk** [renamed from `liquidity_risk` in the Phase 3 liquidity extension to free the term `liquidity` for positional concepts], structural distance to invalidation) from 0 to 100, providing an objective metric for exposure limits. *In the institutional redesign, the Risk Matrix contains 8 unipolar danger dimensions + `overall_risk` (no reward synthesis). Reward evaluation is a Decision-Layer concept and lives in the Decision Matrix as `entry_danger`.*

### 3.16 Decision Support
Decision Support transforms market intelligence into actionable tactical guidance. It is the **only synthesis point** in the platform, combining the Analysis Matrix (state), Opportunity Matrix (forecast), and Risk Matrix (danger) to provide structured recommendations (`trade_readiness`, dynamic stop-loss methods, target take-profit environments, `entry_danger`, `expected_reward_risk_ratio`) without making autonomous execution choices.

### 3.17 Market Overview
Market Overview represents the aggregated state of the entire monitored market universe. Rather than describing one asset, it summarizes cross-market dynamics, such as market breadth, risk distributions, and systemic risk indices.

### 3.18 Execution Policy
An Execution Policy is a user-defined, conditional rule managed by the Trade Automation Engine. Execution policies evaluate incoming decision-support parameters against programmatic constraints to determine whether to trigger an automated order (e.g., `IF analysis.bias == BULLISH AND L4.opportunity_score > 75 AND L5.overall_risk.score < 30 AND stance == ACTIVE THEN Trigger Long`).

### 3.19 Trade Execution
Trade Execution represents the physical interaction with an exchange interface or simulated execution environments. It manages order types, routes, transactional states, slippage controls, and exchange acknowledgments.

> **Target Architecture (Not Yet Implemented).** Trade Execution belongs to the OOP/Domain-Driven **cold path**: order routing, sizing, and transactional state are governed by 128-bit arbitrary-precision decimals (`rust_decimal::Decimal`) to prevent rounding errors and exchange rejections. *Current implementation:* the position-sizing / risk calculator (`crates/portfolio-supervisor/src/risk_calculator.rs`) computes in `f64`; `Decimal` is used for stored order/position fields and quote data.

### 3.20 Position
A Position represents an active market exposure within the portfolio. It contains all real-time tracking parameters, such as entry price, current price, size, unrealized PnL, leverage, and active stop/target coordinates.

### 3.21 Portfolio
A Portfolio represents the complete collection of active positions, balances, margin requirements, and capital allocations. The portfolio provides the global financial and safety boundaries for the trading account.

> **Target Architecture (Not Yet Implemented).** The Portfolio ledger is strictly a cold-path domain: all balances, margin, capital allocations, and fees are maintained with `rust_decimal::Decimal` for penny-perfect cross-asset accounting. The base capital supplied to the sizing protocol is **available margin** (`available_margin`), not raw equity.

### 3.22 Performance
Performance represents the historical evaluation of trading results. It analyzes profitability, realized risk-to-reward ratios, risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe, Sortino), strategy expectancy, and strategy-to-regime compatibility vectors over time.

### 3.23 API Contract
An API Contract is the formalized, typed interface schema exposed by each engine's matrix. It guarantees that external systems can consume engine outputs reliably without dependencies on internal implementation details.

## Chapter 4 — Information Flow

The Trading Platform is fundamentally an information transformation system. Its purpose is to progressively convert raw physical observations into increasingly higher levels of intelligence until they become measurable business outcomes. Information always flows forward. Each stage consumes structured information, enriches it, and produces a new representation that is consumed by the next stage.

```
+--------------------+      +--------------------+      +--------------------+
| Data Infra. Engine | ---> | Market Mon. Engine | ---> | Trade Auto. Engine |
| (Acquires & Clean) |      | (Interprets State) |      | (Evaluates Policy) |
+--------------------+      +--------------------+      +--------------------+
                                                                  |
                                                                  v

+--------------------+      +--------------------+      +--------------------+
```

### 4.1 High-Level Information Flow
The complete Trading Platform transforms information through five major business domains in a controlled, unidirectional cascade:
$$\text{Exchange Data} \longrightarrow \text{Data Infrastructure} \longrightarrow \text{Market Monitoring} \longrightarrow \text{Trade Automation} \longrightarrow \text{Portfolio Management} \longrightarrow \text{Performance Analytics}$$

Each engine increases the abstraction and business value of the information it receives. Reverse dependencies are prohibited; for example, Portfolio Management must not calculate technical indicators, and Market Monitoring must not execute orders.

### 4.2 Information Transformation Sequence
The platform progressively abstracts raw data into business intelligence:
1.  **Raw Data:** Unstructured network events (WebSocket packets, REST responses).
2.  **Observations:** Structured, synchronized temporal OHLCV candles (Market Data).
3.  **Local Confluence:** Telemetry metrics, indicators, and localized signals (Metrics Matrix).
4.  **Relationships:** Multi-timeframe agreement and structural correlation (Alignment Matrix).
5.  **Interpretation:** Categorized market bias, regime diagnostics, and cycle phase (Analysis Matrix).
6.  **Value Assessment:** Quantified potential of structural setups (Opportunity Matrix).
7.  **Vulnerability Assessment:** Quantified environmental threat vectors (Risk Matrix).
8.  **Decision Support:** Actionable tactical guidance and stop/target zones (Decision Matrix).
9.  **Execution Decisions:** Triggered execution policies (Policy Matrix) and order fills (Execution Matrix).
10. **Portfolio State:** Active positions, aggregated exposures, and margin tracking (PortfolioOverviewMatrix).
11. **Performance Intelligence:** Strategy win rates, drawdowns, and strategy-regime maps (Performance Matrix).

### 4.3 Engine Communication Model
Communication between engines always occurs through stable API contracts exchanging read-only, immutable matrix payloads. Engines never access each other's internal variables, databases, or runtime states directly.

### 4.4 Data Infrastructure Engine (DIE) Flow
The DIE transforms raw exchange packets into standardized market data:
$$\text{Exchange APIs} \longrightarrow \text{Raw Data Layer} \longrightarrow \text{Market Data Layer} \longrightarrow \text{Data Quality Layer} \longrightarrow \text{Data Distribution Layer (Distribution Matrix)}$$

The DIE ensures data timeliness and validity before publishing **NormalizedCandle** frames to the Candle Aggregator (via the Distribution Layer, L4). The **Market Data Matrix** is the standardised OHLCV candle schema; the inter-engine analytical transport (indicators, matrices, and telemetry) is the **MarketSnapshot** channel, produced by MME L1 and consumed by MME L2–L7, the UI, and the telemetry logger (see `03-02-02 §8`).

### 4.5 Market Monitoring Engine (MME) Flow
The MME transforms standardized market data into multi-timeframe, explainable market intelligence:
$$\text{Market Data Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Metrics Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Alignment Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Analysis Matrix} \longrightarrow \{\,\text{Opportunity Matrix} \parallel \text{Risk Matrix}\,\} \longrightarrow \text{Decision Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Overview Matrix}$$

This vertical pipeline processes the raw data step-by-step, producing symbol-specific tactical blueprints and global market breadth indicators.

### 4.6 Trade Automation Engine (TAE) Flow
The TAE transforms passive market intelligence into active exchange orders based on policy parameters:
$$\text{Decision Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Policy Layer (Policy Matrix)} \longrightarrow \text{Execution Layer (Execution Matrix)} \longrightarrow \text{Exchange Orders}$$

The TAE never recalculates technical parameters or alters the MME's risk and opportunity ratings; it evaluates configured execution rules and manages order lifecycles.

### 4.7 Portfolio Management Engine (PME) Flow
The PME transforms transactional exchange events and fill confirmations into capital and exposure management states:
$$\text{Exchange Fills} \longrightarrow \text{Position Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Exposure Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Capital Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{PortfolioOverviewMatrix}$$

This pipeline manages position updates, portfolio exposure limits, and margin safety metrics.

### 4.8 Performance Analytics Engine (PAE) Flow
The PAE transforms historical transaction records and recorded market states into long-term system optimization intelligence:
$$\text{Portfolio History} \longrightarrow \text{Trade Analytics Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Strategy Analytics Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Risk Analytics Matrix} \longrightarrow \text{Performance Matrix}$$

The PAE correlates historical trade results with the market regimes diagnosed during those trades, providing a clean feedback loop for strategy refinement.

### 4.9 Information Granularity and Scope
As information moves through the platform, its **granularity** decreases (becoming more abstract and stable), while its **scope** expands:

| Platform Level | Granularity | Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Infrastructure** | High-frequency, raw physical data | Individual network packets / ticker events |
| **Telemetry & Metrics** | Standardized temporal intervals | Single-timeframe, single-symbol parameters |
| **Alignment & Analysis** | Contextual technical states | Multi-timeframe, single-symbol state |
| **Opportunity & Risk** | Evaluative score vectors | Strategy-agnostic symbol potential and vulnerability |
| **Decision Support** | Actionable tactical guidance | Complete tactical blueprint for a single symbol |
| **Automation & Execution** | Conditional, policy-triggered actions | Specific orders and execution logs |
| **Portfolio Management** | High-frequency financial ledger | Combined positions, capital, and global account safety |
| **Performance Analytics**| Statistically stable, long-term ratios | Multi-regime, historical system-wide evaluation |

### 4.10 Direction of Dependencies
To maintain system stability, dependencies must always point forward (upstream to downstream). Downstream engines depend on the outputs of upstream engines. The data plane is unidirectional: no downstream engine mutates upstream state. The only backward channels are: (1) TAE→PME read-only sizing query; (2) PME→TAE VetoMessage; (3) PME→TAE LiquidateCommand; (4) PAE→config offline analytical feedback. The following constraints are direct consequences of the unidirectional data plane:
*   The MME must never depend on active position sizes or execution states to calculate indicator alignment.
*   The TAE must never query the exchange directly to recalculate market regimes.
*   The PME must never compute indicators to manage active stops.

This strict separation of concerns protects the platform from cascading transaction errors and circular logic loops.

### 4.11 Information Integrity and Traceability
At no point in the pipeline should analytical transformations destroy the trace evidence of preceding stages. Every high-level decision or state change must remain fully traceable back to its root indicators and raw exchange inputs, ensuring that the system's actions can always be explained and audited.

### 4.12 Information Flow Design Rules

## Chapter 5 — Trading Platform Ontology

> **Reading order.** This chapter is the **brief** per-engine overview (one paragraph per engine, ASCII composition diagram). The **canonical per-engine boundary contract** — the detailed permitted-actions list, prohibited-actions list, and per-engine delivered matrices — is in **Chapter 14 — Separation of Responsibilities** of this same file. Read Chapter 5 first for orientation; consult Chapter 14 whenever a per-engine boundary question arises.

The Trading Platform is conceptually organized as a decentralized ecosystem of five autonomous engines. Each engine owns a distinct business domain, manages its own internal lifecycle, and communicates exclusively through stable, contract-based APIs.

## Chapter 6 — Market Monitoring Ontology

The Market Monitoring Engine is structured as a pipeline of 7 analytical layers. Layers 1, 2, and 3 are **strictly sequential**. After Layer 3 the pipeline **bifurcates (splits) in parallel**: Layer 4 (Opportunity) and Layer 5 (Risk) calculate independent, orthogonal dimensions of the market directly from the Analysis Matrix — evaluating risk must never depend on the opportunity score, and scoring an opportunity must never be limited by risk. These two independent states then **converge at Layer 6 (Decision Support)** for tactical synthesis, after which Layer 7 aggregates across symbols.

+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 6.1 Metrics Layer (Layer 1)
*   **Concept:** Multidimensional observation.
*   **Responsibility:** Compute mathematical indicators and extract technical signals, projecting each asset metrics stream onto its respective **Evaluation Axes** to generate structured `IndicatorEvaluation` and `SignalEvaluation` objects. It also compiles localized timeframe attributes and standardized analytical features.
*   **Output (Metrics Matrix):** Contains structured multidimensional indicator and signal evaluation objects, alongside localized timeframe attributes. The matrix records **exactly the enabled data** — disabled indicators and signals are absent (never null, never tombstoned) so the cascade faithfully represents what downstream layers considered (see [03-02-12-mme-configurable-activation.md](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-12-mme-configurable-activation.md) for the config-driven **Active Set** that determines presence).
*   **Primary Structural Objects:**
    *   *IndicatorEvaluation:* Evaluates an indicator across the axes of **Value**, **State**, **Direction**, **Strength**, **Market Regime**, **Confidence**, **Freshness**, and **Quality**.
    *   *SignalEvaluation:* Evaluates a signal across the axes of **Signal Type**, **Direction**, **Strength**, **Confidence**, **Freshness**, **Confirmation**, **Market Regime**, **Multi-Timeframe Agreement**, **Risk**, and **Priority**.

### 6.2 Alignment Layer (Layer 2)
*   **Concept:** Horizontal correlation.
*   **Responsibility:** Analyze relationships and measure agreement among multiple timeframes for a single symbol.
*   **Output (Alignment Matrix):** Measures multi-timeframe directional and structural consensus.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   *Trend Alignment Score (0-100%):* Degree of agreement in trend direction across the ACTIVE ladder slots (the fastest `[workspace].active_timeframes` slots of the fixed `micro1`…`longterm2` pool, v11.2).
    *   *Momentum Alignment Score (0-100%):* Concordance of momentum vectors.
    *   *Confluence Matrix:* Grid mapping structural overlap and localized signal intersection points across timeframes.

### 6.3 Analysis Layer (Layer 3)
*   **Concept:** Market Interpretation.
*   **Responsibility:** Synthesize alignment and timeframe metrics into a cohesive technical diagnosis of the asset's overall state.
*   **Output (Analysis Matrix):** Establishes the dominant directional bias, the structural regime, the phase of the market cycle, and the reliability of the trend.
*   **Key Classifications:**
    *   *Market Bias:* `STRONG_BULLISH`, `BULLISH`, `NEUTRAL`, `BEARISH`, `STRONG_BEARISH`.
    *   *Market Regime:* `TRENDING_BULL`, `TRENDING_BEAR`, `RANGE`, `ACCUMULATION`, `DISTRIBUTION`, `EXPANSION`, `CONTRACTION`, `TRANSITION`.[^regime-canonical]
    *   *Market Phase:* `ACCUMULATION`, `MARKUP`, `DISTRIBUTION`, `MARKDOWN` — 4 phases plus the `UNKNOWN` empty-state sentinel.
    *   *Market Quality (0-100):* Measure of trend clarity and structural predictability.

[^regime-canonical]: **Canonical vocabulary.** The authoritative `MarketRegime` enum is defined in [Appendix A.3](#a3-analysis-matrix-schema-mme--layer-3) and [02-02-analysis-matrix.md §3.2](../matrices/02-02-analysis-matrix.md); this prose is mirrored from there.

### 6.4 Opportunity Layer (Layer 4)
*   **Concept:** Favorable environment tracking.
*   **Responsibility:** Evaluate the structural and momentum conditions to determine if they support high-probability trading configurations. This layer is strictly non-execution-based; it identifies potential, not action. It reads directly from the **Analysis Matrix (Layer 3)**, running in parallel with the Risk Layer (Layer 5).
*   **Output (Opportunity Matrix):** Identifies and scores specific tactical opportunity vectors. Fed directly to Layer 6 (Decision Support).

### 6.5 Risk Layer (Layer 5)
*   **Concept:** Environmental danger tracking.
*   **Responsibility:** Quantify structural, technical, and execution risks present in the market environment, independent of directional bias. It reads directly from the **Analysis Matrix (Layer 3)**, executing independently from, and in parallel with, the Opportunity Layer (Layer 4).
*   **Output (Risk Matrix):** Compiles and scores multi-dimensional risk factors on a unipolar scale. Fed directly to Layer 6 (Decision Support).

### 6.6 Decision Layer (Layer 6)
*   **Concept:** Decision support and actionable guidance.
*   **Responsibility:** The **convergence (synthesis) boundary** where the two parallel branches merge. Synthesize the Analysis Matrix (Regime/Bias), the Opportunity Matrix (Layer 4), and the Risk Matrix (Layer 5) into structured, strategy-agnostic Decision Matrix profiles. It determines market compatibility and protection parameters.
*   **Output (Decision Matrix):** Unified tactical blueprint for a single symbol.
*   **Key Elements:**

    *   *Directional Guidance:* `directional_guidance` — primary trade direction inferred from multi-timeframe analysis.
    *   *Market Stance:* `market_stance` — `AGGRESSIVE`, `CONSTRUCTIVE`, `NEUTRAL`, `CAUTIOUS`, `AVOID` (five-variant enum).
    *   *Entry Guidance:* `entry_guidance` — `IMMEDIATE`, `PULLBACK`, `BREAKOUT`, `WAIT`, `STAND_ASIDE` (five-variant enum).
    *   *Exit Guidance:* `exit_guidance` — structural exit conditions (trailing stop, target-based, time-based).
    *   *Strategy Environment:* Categorical classification of which strategy class is currently favored — `TREND_FOLLOWING`, `BREAKOUT`, `MEAN_REVERSION`, `HIGH_VOLATILITY`, `LOW_ACTIVITY`, `UNFAVORABLE` (six-state enum; see [Decision Matrix §3.3](../matrices/02-04-decision-matrix.md)).
    *   *Protection Strategy:* `STRUCTURE_BASED`, `VOLATILITY_BASED`, `ATR_BASED`, `SR_BASED`, `NO_RECOMMENDATION` (five-variant enum; see [Decision Matrix §3.6](../matrices/02-04-decision-matrix.md)). `NO_RECOMMENDATION` is reached on the empty-state fallback (no indicators available; see §A.6).
    *   *Target Strategy:* `RESISTANCE_BASED`, `RR_BASED`, `VOLATILITY_BASED`, `TRAILING_METHOD`, `NO_RECOMMENDATION` (five-variant enum; see [Decision Matrix §3.7](../matrices/02-04-decision-matrix.md)). `NO_RECOMMENDATION` is reached on the empty-state fallback.
    *   *Final Recommendation:* `final_recommendation` — structured summary of the tactical blueprint.
    *   *Risk-Adjusted Reward:* `entry_danger` (renamed from `risk_favorability`) and `expected_reward_risk_ratio` — see [Decision Matrix §2.1](../matrices/02-04-decision-matrix.md).
    *   *Confidence Assessment:* `confidence_assessment = clamp(state_confidence × (1 − overall_risk / 100) × 100, 0, 100)` — the risk-attenuated terminal output (see [Decision Matrix §6](../matrices/02-04-decision-matrix.md)).
    *   *Decision Context:* `decision_context` — inner structure carrying the synthesis weights and contributing factors (see §A.6).
    *   *Scenario Analysis:*
        *   `Primary Scenario:` Most probable path (e.g., `BULLISH_CONTINUATION`).
        *   `Alternative Scenario:` Most probable failure path (e.g., `BREAKDOWN_AND_LIQUIDITY_SWEEP`).
        *   `Invalidation Trigger:` Concrete market parameters that nullify the primary scenario.

### 6.7 Overview Layer (Layer 7)
*   **Concept:** Global market breadth.
*   **Responsibility:** Aggregate individual asset Decision Matrices into a unified state representation of the entire monitored market universe.
*   **Output (Overview Matrix):** Summarizes market-wide dynamics for portfolio allocation and systemic risk control.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   *Market Breadth Indices:* Percentage of symbols exhibiting Bullish vs. Bearish biases.
    *   *Regime Distribution:* Mapping of how many symbols are in expansion vs. contraction regimes.
    *   *Asset Rankings:* Leaderboard of strongest and weakest symbols based on Quality and Opportunity scores.
    *   *Systemic Risk Score (0-100):* Cross-market aggregated risk metric representing market-wide danger levels.

### 6.7.1 Fractional Layers: L1.5 (Derivatives Telemetry) and L2.5 (Liquidity Synthesis)

The Liquidity Intelligence extension (Phase 0-4) inserts two fractional layers between the standard L1–L2–L3 spine. These are additive, not replacements — the foundational 7-layer model remains the structural backbone.

- **L1.5 (Derivatives Telemetry):** Consumes WebSocket and REST derivatives data (open interest, funding rate, mark/index prices, liquidation events) from Hyperliquid and Bitget. Produces `LiquidityFlow`, attached to `MarketSnapshot.liquidity`. Outputs: `latest_mark_px`, `latest_index_px`, `latest_oi`, `latest_funding`.
- **L2.5 (Liquidity Synthesis):** Consumes L1.5 state, L1 candle history (last 200 micro closes), and configuration (leverage distribution, maintenance margin rate). Produces `LiquidationClusterMatrix`, attached to `MarketSnapshot.cluster`, and `Vec<LiquiditySignal>` on `MarketSnapshot.liquidity_signals`. Refreshed every 5 minutes.

**Cascade invariant:** L1.5 and L2.5 feed both L4 (for `LiquiditySqueeze` opportunity precondition — `cascade_state` and `cascade_asymmetry`) and L5 (for `cascade_risk`, the 8th unipolar danger sub-dimension). L2.5 does not read from L1.5's Phase 1 output (LiquidityFlow) for feedback-loop avoidance; it does consume Phase 0 outputs (open interest, funding rate, mark/index prices) from L1.5's production. The unidirectional invariant is preserved: L4 and L5 remain orthogonal, and L5 → L6 remains unidirectional.

See [03-02-11-mme-liquidity-extension.md](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-11-mme-liquidity-extension.md) for the full cascade invariant and cross-engine impact.

## Chapter 7 — Trade Automation Ontology

The Trade Automation Engine bridges the gap between passive intelligence (MME) and execution. It evaluates user-defined risk parameters and programmatic constraints to execute transaction rules.

### 7.1 Policy Layer (Layer 1)
*   **Concept:** Conditional validation rules.
*   **Responsibility:** Evaluate active Execution Policies against incoming symbol-specific Decision Matrices and active global Overview Matrices.
*   **Output (Policy Matrix):** List of triggered policies, containing exact entry/exit/management directives.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   *Execution Policy:* A deterministic programmatic rule.
        *   *Example Structure:* `IF (analysis.bias == BULLISH) AND (L4.opportunity_score > 75) AND (L5.overall_risk.score < 40) THEN Trigger LONG`.
    *   *Stance Definition:* Automated execution states per symbol:
        *   `ACTIVE` — Full automated trading permitted.
        *   `CLOSE_ONLY` — Only exit or protection-tightening operations allowed.
        *   `AVOID` — Strictly block all execution triggers.

### 7.2 Execution Layer (Layer 2)
*   **Concept:** Transaction implementation.
*   **Responsibility:** Translate approved policy actions into physical order messages, select routing methods, and manage order execution state. It executes the **Allocation Sizing Protocol**, calculating entry position size using the v8.2 portfolio-share model:
$$\text{notional} = \frac{\text{equity} \times \text{allocation\_pct}}{100}, \qquad \text{size\_units} = \frac{\text{notional}}{\text{entry\_price}}$$
	where `allocation_pct` ∈ 1–100 % is the configured portfolio share for the instance (default 10 %; per-instance override; the sum of all instance allocations is validated ≤ 100 %).
*   **Output (Execution Matrix):** Structured database of outstanding, filled, modified, and cancelled orders.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   *Order Routing Strategy:* Logic determining whether to deploy `Limit Orders`, `Market Orders`, `Stop Orders`, or `TWAP/VWAP Execution Schemes`.
    *   *Slippage Control:* Algorithms adjusting limit offsets based on immediate order book depth.
    *   *Transaction State:* `PENDING → SUBMITTED → OPEN → PARTIALLY_FILLED → CLOSED`, with terminal `REJECTED` / `CANCELLED`; a Gate 2 (readiness), Gate 5, or manual-review hold parks the order in `PRE_DISPATCH` (`HELD_FOR_REVIEW`) before `PENDING`.

    *   `Position Size:` Base asset size.
    *   `Current Price:` Immediate index or mark price.
    *   `Unrealized PnL / ROI:` Live dollar and percentage return.
    *   `Stop Loss Trigger:` Operational coordinate of active protection.
    *   `Take Profit Coordinates:` Programmatic target execution points.

### 8.2 Exposure Layer (Layer 2)
*   **Concept:** Risk aggregation.
*   **Responsibility:** Group positions across correlated sectors, asset types, or asset baskets to prevent overexposure to specific market vectors.
*   **Output (Exposure Matrix):** Risk distribution maps across predefined boundaries.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   *Gross Portfolio Exposure:* Total combined nominal value of all active positions.
    *   *Net Portfolio Exposure:* Combined directional bias (Long nominal value minus Short nominal value).
    *   *Sector/Asset Concentration:* Percentage of total capital allocated to a single asset or closely correlated group of assets.

### 8.3 Capital Layer (Layer 3)
*   **Concept:** Account solvency monitoring.
*   **Responsibility:** Track available margin, leverage ratios, equity curves, and funding impacts.
*   **Output (Capital Matrix):** High-frequency balance sheet of the trading account.
*   **Key Fields:**
    *   `Initial Balance:` Starting capital.
    *   `Current Equity:` Balance + Unrealized PnL.
    *   `Available Margin:` Liquid capital available for new position initiation.
    *   `Margin Usage Ratio:` Percentage of total equity committed to maintenance/initial margin requirements.
    *   `Effective Leverage:` Ratio of gross exposure to total account equity.

### 8.4 Overview Layer (Layer 4)
*   **Concept:** Unified portfolio state.
*   **Responsibility:** Synthesize Position, Exposure, and Capital matrices into a single, high-level status vector representing the absolute financial health of the trading system. It maintains the **safety-state ladder** (`NORMAL` / `WARN` / `CAUTIOUS` / `SUSPENDED` / `DRAWDOWN_STOP`) as a read-only status; the TAE setup executor's soft gate blocks *new entries* in `DRAWDOWN_STOP` / `SUSPENDED` — no veto, no stance override, no order cancellation.
*   **Output (PortfolioOverviewMatrix):** Unified ledger used for high-level automated safety reporting (e.g., portfolio-wide drawdown stops, maximum margin warnings).

  +-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 10.1 Phase 1: Inception / Discovery
*   **Description:** The market is continuously monitored. Technical indicators, signals, and multi-timeframe alignments are computed for all active symbols. 
*   **Milestone:** The Market Monitoring Engine generates a fresh **Analysis Matrix**, establishing a clear directional bias and identifying an active regime (e.g., `TRENDING_BULL` during a `MARKUP` cycle phase).

### 10.2 Phase 2: Evaluation / Tactical Support
*   **Description:** The technical setup is evaluated to determine positive potential and environmental danger.
*   **Milestone:** The **Opportunity Matrix** and **Risk Matrix** are generated. These are processed by the Decision Layer to produce a **Decision Matrix**, declaring the asset's *Trade Readiness* as `READY` or `FORMING` and establishing concrete structural invalidation zones.

### 10.3 Phase 3: Trigger Validation
*   **Description:** The Trade Automation Engine's Policy Layer processes the **Decision Matrix**. It checks whether the symbol's readiness, opportunity scores, and risk classifications satisfy any active, user-configured execution policies.
*   **Milestone:** A programmatic policy condition is fully satisfied, generating a trigger command in the **Policy Matrix**.

### 10.4 Phase 4: Execution Routing
*   **Description:** The Policy trigger is translated into actionable exchange commands. Capital parameters (from the PME Capital Matrix) are referenced to calculate exact position sizing based on risk-per-trade guidelines.
*   **Milestone:** Order messages are dispatched to the target exchange, and the **Execution Matrix** tracks the order states until they are confirmed as `Filled`.

### 10.5 Phase 5: Supervision / Active Management
*   **Description:** The filled order becomes an active position. The Portfolio Management Engine takes ownership of tracking live valuation changes, margin commitments, and total portfolio exposure.
*   **Milestone:** The active position is continuously updated in the **Position Matrix**. Stop loss levels and target take profit zones are managed dynamically based on ongoing Market Monitoring updates.

### 10.6 Phase 6: Liquidation / Exit
*   **Description:** The exit criteria are met. This can occur via a hit stop loss, reached profit target, a structural invalidation signal from the Market Monitoring Engine, or a portfolio-wide drawdown emergency trigger.
*   **Milestone:** Exit orders are executed, the market exposure is cleared, and the final transactional data is written to the database. The position status is updated to `Closed` in the **Position Matrix**.

### 10.7 Phase 7: Reconstruction / Analytics
*   **Description:** The completed transaction is handed over to the Performance Analytics Engine. 
*   **Milestone:** The execution fills, entry/exit coordinates, and environmental market states are analyzed to update the **Trade Analytics Matrix** and refine the **the Performance Matrix's regime_compatibility section**.

## Chapter 11 — Relationship Between Engines and Lifecycle

Engines do not own the trading lifecycle individually; instead, they collaborate sequentially, passing structured matrices to coordinate transition states. The matrix below defines which engine leads, supports, or remains inactive during each phase of a trade's lifecycle.

| Lifecycle Phase | Data Infrastructure Engine (DIE) | Market Monitoring Engine (MME) | Trade Automation Engine (TAE) | Portfolio Management Engine (PME) | Performance Analytics Engine (PAE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Inception** | **Lead** (Provides raw and normalized candle streams) | **Lead** (Computes features, alignment, and regime) | Inactive | Inactive | Inactive |
| **2. Evaluation** | Support (Provides real-time book depth / spread) | **Lead** (Quantifies Opportunity, Risk, and Decision support) | Inactive | Inactive | Inactive |
| **3. Trigger** | Inactive | Support (Updates Decision Matrix parameters) | **Lead** (Validates active programmatic policy rules) | Support (Provides capital balance metrics for sizing) | Inactive |
| **4. Routing** | Inactive | Inactive | **Lead** (Determines order routes and manages fills) | Support (Blocks execution if margin limits are breached) | Inactive |
| **5. Supervision**| Support (Updates current market mark prices) | Support (Identifies dynamic structure changes) | Support (Modifies orders if dynamic exit rules trigger) | **Lead** (Tracks active position metrics and net exposure) | Inactive |
| **6. Liquidation**| Inactive | Support (Signals structural invalidation if reached) | **Lead** (Executes liquidation and exit order sequences) | Support (Reclaims margin and updates balance ledgers) | Inactive |
| **7. Analytics** | Inactive | Inactive | Inactive | Support (Exposes historical trade logs and equity values) | **Lead** (Reconstructs trades, groups metrics, maps regimes) |

## Chapter 12 — Information Hierarchy

> **Note.** This chapter presents a 5-level summary. The canonical 8-level model lives in [Chapter 13](#chapter-13--levels-of-abstraction) and supersedes this summary. The mapping is: 5-level L1 (Granular/Transactional) → Ch.13 L1+L2 (Granular Physical State + Microstructure); 5-level L2 → Ch.13 L3 (Inter-Temporal Correlation); 5-level L3 → Ch.13 L4 (Market Interpretation); 5-level L4 → Ch.13 L5 (Opportunity & Risk Evaluation); 5-level L5 → Ch.13 L6+L7+L8 (Targeting & Strategy + Systemic Context + Performance Meta-Intelligence).

Information in the Trading Platform is organized hierarchically. Data begins at a high-frequency, granular level and is progressively aggregated, filtered, and contextualized into increasingly stable and abstract representations.

| [Level 8: Performance Meta-Intelligence] -> Strategy/Regime mapping         |
| [Level 7: Systemic Context]               -> Market Breadth, Portfolio State |
| [Level 6: Tactical Guidance]              -> Stop/Target areas, Readiness    |
| [Level 5: Opportunity & Risk Evaluation]  -> Opp. & Risk Scoring Matrices   |

## Chapter 14 — Separation of Responsibilities

> **Canonical per-engine boundary contract.** Where **Chapter 5 — Trading Platform Ontology** of this file is a brief per-engine overview, this chapter is the **canonical authoritative reference** for the per-engine permitted-actions, prohibited-actions, and delivered matrices. Documentation that needs to assert "engine X may do Y" or "engine X may not do Z" must cite this chapter (or its sub-section for a specific engine: §14.0 DIE, §14.1 MME, §14.2 TAE, §14.3 PME, §14.4 PAE). The DIE boundary contract is fully stated in §14.0 below.

To maintain modularity and prevent coupling, the platform enforces strict boundaries of responsibility between its core engines. No engine may assume, calculate, or manipulate data belonging to another engine's business domain.

## Chapter 15 — Communication Model

The platform uses a contract-based, decoupled communication architecture. Engines operate as isolated computational processes, exchanging immutable snapshots of their state via standardized message interfaces.

### 15.1 Flow Directionality
*   **Unidirectional Information Flow:** Information always cascades forward from raw observations to meta-intelligence.
    $$\text{Data Infrastructure} \longrightarrow \text{Market Monitoring} \longrightarrow \text{Trade Automation} \longrightarrow \text{Portfolio Management} \longrightarrow \text{Performance Analytics}$$
*   **Backward Channels (restricted):** The data plane is strictly unidirectional, but four controlled backward channels exist:
    *   **(1) Sizing Feedback:** TAE queries PME Capital Matrix for available margin to size positions.
    *   **(2) PME→TAE Safety State:** PME Overview Layer publishes the safety-state ladder consumed by the TAE soft entry gate.
    *   **(3) PME→TAE LiquidateCommand:** PME orders emergency liquidation during Hard Exit.
    *   **(4) PAE→config Analytical Feedback:** PAE provides historical performance analysis to configuration databases for off-line policy optimization.

### 15.2 Communication Paradigms
1.  **Publish / Subscribe (Pub/Sub):**
    *   *Usage:* Real-time, continuous data dissemination.
    *   *Examples:* Normalized exchange ticks (Raw Data Matrix, DIE L1), standardized candle updates (Market Data Matrix), and real-time analytical updates (Decision Matrix).
    *   *Guarantee:* High-throughput, low-latency, non-blocking delivery.
2.  **Request / Response:**
    *   *Usage:* On-demand state queries or transaction execution commands.
    *   *Examples:* Querying active margin limits from PME, sending an execution order to TAE, or requesting historical performance metrics from PAE.
    *   *Guarantee:* Synchronous or asynchronous state confirmation with explicit error handling.

### 15.3 State Preservation and Serialization
*   **Immutability:** Every matrix generated by an analytical layer is treated as an immutable snapshot. Once published, a matrix cannot be altered. Changes over time are represented by a chronological sequence of versioned matrices.
*   **Payload Structuring:** Communication payloads must adhere to strict schemas (JSON Schema) to enforce boundaries and prevent serialization drift. No language-specific object serialization is permitted between engines.

## Appendix A — Formal Matrix Definitions

This appendix is an illustrative serialization of the canonical scenario (seed: [02-01-alignment-matrix.md §6](../matrices/02-01-alignment-matrix.md)) for all matrices produced by the Market Monitoring Engine. Normative contracts live in `docs/matrices/02-*`. Field set verified by MANIFEST gate G13. All enum values serialize as `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. **Note (v11.1):** the worked scenario demonstrates the math on a 4-timeframe subset (`timeframes_present: 4` — a mid-warmup instance); production instances run the full fixed 10-slot ladder (`micro1`…`longterm2`), so the live field ranges 0–10. The chain numbers are unchanged.

---

### A.1 Metrics Matrix Schema (MME — Layer 1)

Produced by the Metrics Layer: one `MarketSnapshot` per TimeframePipeline candle. This is the foundational observation object, containing the full `indicators` map of `IndicatorEvaluation` entries, each with nested `signals`, plus the attached higher-order matrices (Alignment, Analysis, Opportunity, Risk, Decision).

**Key structural rules:**
- All `Decimal` price/size fields serialize as **JSON numbers** (`rust_decimal` `serde-float`).
- `Option::None` fields serialize as JSON `null`, unless the field carries `#[serde(skip_serializing_if)]` (e.g. `liquidity_signals`, `clusters`, `volume_profiles`).
- Signals are **nested inside each indicator** under the `signals: [IndicatorSignal]` array — there is no top-level `signals` map.
- Divergence signals use `kind: "DIVERGENCE"` and are pushed onto the parent indicator's `signals` array (e.g., a bullish RSI divergence appears under `rsi.signals`).

### A.2 Alignment Matrix Schema (MME — Layer 2)

Produced by the Alignment Layer. Consumes multiple per-timeframe Metrics Matrices for one symbol and computes 10-dimensional cross-timeframe agreement.

Full specification: [Alignment Matrix](../matrices/02-01-alignment-matrix.md).

```json

}
```

**The 10 Alignment Dimensions (ordered):**
| # | Dimension | Measures |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 0 | Trend | Directional trend agreement |
| 1 | Momentum | Momentum-vector agreement |
| 2 | Volume | Participation agreement |
| 3 | Volatility | Volatility-regime agreement |
| 4 | Structure | S/R role agreement |
| 5 | Signal | Cross-TF signal confluence |
| 6 | Regime | Regime-classification agreement |
| 7 | Confidence | Confidence consistency |
| 8 | Liquidity | RVOL consistency |
| 9 | **Tradability** | Cross-timeframe tradability agreement *(renamed from "Opportunity" in the institutional redesign — L4 owns opportunity concepts; this dimension measures TFs agreeing on tradability)* |

---

### A.3 Analysis Matrix Schema (MME — Layer 3)

Produced by the Analysis Layer. Consumes the Alignment Matrix and produces a structured diagnosis of market bias, regime, and quality.

Full specification: [Analysis Matrix](../matrices/02-02-analysis-matrix.md).

```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "bias": "Bullish",
  "state_confidence": 0.65,
  "market_regime": "TrendingBull",
  "trend_assessment": "Healthy",
  "momentum_assessment": "Stable",
  "structure_assessment": "Healthy",
  "volatility_assessment": "Expanding",
  "volume_assessment": "Strong",
  "market_quality": "Good",
  "market_quality_score": 65.75,
  "trend_score": 76.5,
  "momentum_score": 83.2,
  "structure_score": 81.4,
  "volatility_score": 55.0,
  "volume_score": 78.8,
  "market_interpretation": "Bullish trending market with healthy trend, stable momentum, healthy structure, expanding volatility, and strong volume participation. Favors trend continuation.",
  "rationale": "MTF overall score 40/100 → BULLISH. Majority of 4 timeframes agree (75%). 3 signals across multiple timeframes.",
  "supporting_signals": ["fast180 (bullish): score +42, TRENDING regime, 3 signals"],
  "contradicting_signals": [],
  "timeframes_considered": 4
}
```

**Classification vocabularies (wire values are PascalCase — no serde rename on the analysis enums):**
- **MarketBias:** `StrongBullish` (`score > 40`), `Bullish` (`20 < score ≤ 40`), `Neutral` (`-20 ≤ score ≤ 20`), `Bearish` (`-40 ≤ score < -20`), `StrongBearish` (`score < -40`) — half-open intervals so the same score never maps to two bands.
- **MarketRegime:** `TrendingBull`, `TrendingBear`, `Range`, `Accumulation`, `Distribution`, `Expansion`, `Contraction`, `Transition` *(canonical source: [02-02-analysis-matrix.md §3.2](../matrices/02-02-analysis-matrix.md); this appendix mirrors it)*
- **QualityLevel:** `Poor`, `Weak`, `Average`, `Good`, `Excellent`

> Per [02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md](../matrices/02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md), the canonical JSON key is **`state_confidence`**. Code truth: `AnalysisMatrix` also serializes a `confidence` mirror with the identical value (a UI-facing duplicate retained since the institutional redesign — see [02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md §2](../matrices/02-00b-confidence-hierarchy.md)); consumers should read `state_confidence`.

The continuous **market_bias_score ∈ [−1, +1]** is the signed Alignment Matrix's `mtf_overall_score` divided by 100 (the score carries the sign of the dominant bias direction).

---

### A.4 Opportunity Matrix Schema (MME — Layer 4)

Produced by the Opportunity Layer. Consumes the Analysis Matrix and underlying Metrics Matrix signals to profile strategy-agnostic setup viability. The contract is **direction-neutral**: it does not emit a directional bias. Direction is the responsibility of the Decision Matrix and TAE.

Full specification: [Opportunity Matrix](../matrices/02-08-opportunity-matrix.md).

```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "primary_opportunity": "TrendContinuation",
  "opportunity_score": 85.0,
  "setup_quality": "Prime",
  "forecast_confidence": 0.81,
  "profiles": [
    {
      "opportunity_type": "TrendContinuation",
      "score": 85.0,
      "preconditions_met": 3,
      "preconditions_total": 3,
      "notes": "§4 tree rule 1: trend score 78 ≥ 75, bias BULLISH, momentum STABLE."
    },
    {
      "opportunity_type": "BREAKOUT",
      "score": 78.0,
      "preconditions_met": 2,
      "preconditions_total": 3,
      "notes": "Volatility expanding, structure healthy; loses §4 tree priority to trend continuation."
    }
  ],
  "contributing_signals": ["squeeze:COMPRESSION_RELEASE", "donchian:BREAKOUT_UP"],
  "invalidation_note": "A close below 63440.0 on the completed candle invalidates the TrendContinuation thesis.",
  "entry_zone":  { "low": 64000.0, "high": 64200.0 },
  "target_zone": { "low": 65500.0, "high": 66000.0 },
  "invalidation_level": 63440.0,
  "long_expected_rr_internal": 2.5,
  "short_expected_rr_internal": 0.0,
  "time_horizon": "SWING"
}
```

**Setup Quality bands (lower-inclusive half-open intervals `[a, b)`):** `PRIME` (`≥ 85`), `STRONG` (`[70, 85)`), `MODERATE` (`[50, 70)`), `MARGINAL` (`[30, 50)`), `NONE` (`< 30`). The half-open form ensures each `opportunity_score` maps to exactly one band; the example's 85.0 ∈ [85, 100] → `PRIME` (canonical bands: [02-08-opportunity-matrix.md §5](../matrices/02-08-opportunity-matrix.md)).

**Scoring model:** `score = 0.35·Q_ctx + 0.30·S_sig + 0.20·A_mtf + 0.15·F_fresh`

> The JSON key for confidence is **`forecast_confidence`** (not `confidence`).
>
> **Institutional redesign fields.** `entry_zone`, `target_zone`, `invalidation_level`, `long_/short_expected_rr_internal`, and `time_horizon` are required fields for PM-consumable setup profiles. The L4 opportunity-reward fields are `long_expected_rr_internal` and `short_expected_rr_internal` (per-direction, distinct from the L6 Decision-Layer `expected_reward_risk_ratio`); the active side is resolved by `analysis.bias`. The legacy matrix-level `expected_rr_internal` was removed in v6.9. The L4 invalidation field is `invalidation_level` (canonical across L4, Decision Matrix, and Position Matrix).

The canonical `OpportunityType` enum has **eight** variants (six original + `LiquiditySqueeze` added in the Phase 0-4 Liquidity Intelligence extension + `Scalp` added in the v2.1 institutional completeness sweep):

`TrendContinuation`, `Breakout`, `Pullback`, `MeanReversion`, `Reversal`, `LiquiditySqueeze`, `Scalp`, `NoClearOpportunity`.

See [02-08-opportunity-matrix.md §3](../matrices/02-08-opportunity-matrix.md) for the precondition signatures.

### A.5 Risk Matrix Schema (MME — Layer 5)

Produced by the Risk Layer. Consumes the Analysis Matrix and underlying indicator signals, quantifying environmental danger on a `[0, 100]` scale, **independent of directional bias**. The Risk Matrix contains **eight unipolar danger sub-dimensions** plus `overall_risk` (the weighted aggregate of those eight) — **nine fields total**. `cascade_risk` is the 8th of the eight sub-dimensions (added in the Phase 0-4 Liquidity Intelligence extension, replacing the retired `expected_rr`/`sync_risk`). `expected_rr` was removed and moved to the Decision Layer as `entry_danger`.

Full specification: [Risk Matrix](../matrices/02-11-risk-matrix.md).

```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "market_risk": { "score": 35.0, "level": "Low", "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0, "evidence": ["High confidence"] },
  "volatility_risk": { "score": 45.0, "level": "Moderate", "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0, "evidence": ["BBWP elevated"] },
  "execution_liquidity_risk": { "score": 15.0, "level": "VeryLow", "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0, "evidence": ["Strong participation"] },
  "structure_risk": { "score": 25.0, "level": "Low", "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0 },
  "momentum_risk": { "score": 20.0, "level": "Low", "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0 },
  "signal_risk": { "score": 30.0, "level": "Low", "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0 },

}
```

**9 Risk Dimensions:**
| Dimension | Threat Vector |
|-----------|--------------|
| `market_risk` | General uncertainty from conflicting signals / weak structure |
| `volatility_risk` | Danger from abnormal price movement |
| `execution_liquidity_risk` | Poor market participation / thin volume |
| `structure_risk` | Weak or damaged price structure |
| `momentum_risk` | Exhausted / diverging momentum |
| `signal_risk` | Conflicting or unreliable signals |
| `execution_risk` | Practical difficulty (spread, slippage, thin book). **v6.11:** carries the optional `volatility_to_spread_ratio` (`ATR(14) ÷ top-of-book spread`, execution-friction gauge; absent on the other eight dimensions). |
| `cascade_risk` | Forced liquidation cascade danger (Phase 3) |
| `overall_risk` | Weighted aggregate: `0.14M + 0.14V + 0.14L_ex + 0.10S + 0.14Mo + 0.10Sig + 0.10E + 0.14C` |

**RiskLevel bands (wire values PascalCase):** `score ≥ 80 → Extreme`, `≥ 60 → High`, `≥ 40 → Moderate`, `≥ 20 → Low`, else `VeryLow`.

### A.6 Decision Matrix Schema (MME — Layer 6)

Produced by the Decision Layer. Synthesizes the Analysis, Opportunity, and Risk matrices into structured tactical guidance: trade readiness, directional guidance, protection/target strategies, and scenario pathways. The Decision Matrix is the terminal output the Trade Automation Engine consumes.

Full specification: [Decision Matrix](../matrices/02-04-decision-matrix.md).

```json
{
  "advisory": {
    "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
    "directional_guidance": "Long",
    "market_stance": "Constructive",
    "strategy_environment": "TrendFollowing",
    "entry_guidance": "Pullback",
    "exit_guidance": "NoWarning",
    "protection_strategy": "ATRBased",
    "target_strategy": "ResistanceBased",
    "quality_to_risk_ratio": 3.53,
    "confidence_assessment": 46.61,
    "final_recommendation": "Long bias forming: Bullish with 46.6% confidence; Prime setup; await confirmation before full sizing."
  },
  "decision_context": {
    "score": 86.725,
    "bias": "Bullish",
    "score_confidence": 0.87,
    "trade_readiness": "FORMING",
    "entry_danger": { "score": 20.0, "level": "Low", "state": "Stable", "confidence": 50.0 },
    "expected_reward_risk_ratio": 1.79,
    "contributing_indicators": ["ema_stack", "macd", "adx", "squeeze"]
  }
}
```

> **Removed field.** The previous `opportunity_type` field is **not serialized**. The canonical setup classifier lives in the L4 Opportunity Matrix as `primary_opportunity` (see [02-00-matrix-field-ownership.md §3](../matrices/02-00-matrix-field-ownership.md)).
>
> The JSON key for confidence in `decision_context` is **`score_confidence`** (not `confidence`). The `confidence_assessment` field on `advisory` is a separate terminal field (the risk-attenuated output, not part of the four-level pipeline confidence flow).
>
> **Institutional redesign fields.** `trade_readiness`, `entry_danger`, and `expected_reward_risk_ratio` live on **`decision_context`** (not `advisory`). `opportunity_type` is gone (read from L4 instead). `entry_danger.evidence` is not populated by the backend (the array is omitted from the wire).

> **Worked example for the JSON above (matches Risk Matrix §A.5).** With `analysis.state_confidence = 0.65`, `L5.overall_risk.score = 28.3`, `L4.long_expected_rr_internal = 2.5` (active side for bullish bias), `L4.opportunity_score = 85.0`, and the L2 tradability dimension `100.0`:
>
> - `entry_danger.score = mean(quality_penalty, 100 − opportunity_score) = mean(25, 15) = 20.0` (GOOD quality ⇒ `quality_penalty = 25`)
> - `expected_reward_risk_ratio = (active-side R:R) × (1 − L5.overall_risk / 100) = 2.5 × (1 − 0.283) = 1.79`
> - `quality_to_risk_ratio = market_quality_score ÷ overall_risk.score = 65.75 ÷ 28.3 ≈ 2.32` (v6.11 setup-efficiency metric; `None` when risk = 0)
> - `confidence_assessment = state_confidence × (1 − overall_risk / 100) × 100 = 0.65 × 0.717 × 100 = 46.61`
> - `decision_context.score = 0.5 × tradability(100.0) + 0.3 × market_quality_score(65.75) + 0.2 × opportunity_score(85.0) = 86.725`
>
> See [Decision Matrix §6](../matrices/02-04-decision-matrix.md) for the corresponding worked calculation.

**Trade Readiness** (`READY` | `FORMING` | `WATCH` | `STAND_ASIDE`) is derived from directional guidance × risk-discounted confidence × market stance. Confidence is always risk-attenuated:

$$\text{confidence\_assessment} = \text{clamp}\Big(\text{analysis.state\_confidence} \times \big(1 - \tfrac{\text{overall\_risk}}{100}\big) \times 100,\ 0,\ 100\Big)$$

### A.7 Overview Matrix Schema (MME — Layer 7)

Produced by the Overview Layer. Aggregates every symbol's Decision Matrix into cross-market breadth indices, asset rankings, and a systemic risk score consumed by the PME safety veto.

Full specification: [Overview Matrix](../matrices/02-09-overview-matrix.md).

```json
{
  "global_market_bias": "BULLISH",
  "market_breadth": "POSITIVE",
  "regime_distribution": { "TRENDING_BULL": 0.6, "RANGE": 0.4 },
  "opportunity_distribution": { "BREAKOUT": 2, "TREND_CONTINUATION": 1 },
  "risk_distribution": {
    "low_pct": 20.0,
    "moderate_pct": 20.0,
    "high_pct": 60.0,
    "risk_environment": "HIGH_RISK"
  },
  "cascade_risk_index": { "score": null, "level": null, "state": "NO_DATA", "confidence": 0.0, "evidence": ["Field is part of the canonical schema but the value is a placeholder (not yet wired into systemic_risk_score). See 01-05-liquidity-domain.md §Open questions."] },
  "asset_ranking": [
    { "symbol": "BTC-USDT", "score": 87.5, "bias": "LONG", "confidence": 75.0, "regime": "TREND_FOLLOWING", "risk_level": "MODERATE" }
  ],
  "market_synchronization": "SYNCHRONIZED",
  "market_health": "HEALTHY",
  "global_summary": "5 active instances across 5 symbols. Global bias: BULLISH with positive market breadth. (ranking abridged to 1 of 5 instances)",
  "instance_count": 5,
  "active_symbols": ["BTC-USDT", "ETH-USDT", "SOL-USDT", "AVAX-USDT", "MATIC-USDT"],
  "systemic_risk_score": 36.0
}
```

**Systemic Risk Score** (consumed by PME veto loop):

$$\text{SystemicRisk} = 0.6 \cdot \text{high\_pct} + 0.4 \cdot \text{sync\_penalty}$$

> **Worked example for the JSON above.** `instance_count = 5`, distributed as 1 low-risk (20 %) + 1 moderate-risk (20 %) + 3 high-risk (60 %). `global_market_bias = BULLISH` ⇒ `sync_penalty = 0` regardless of synchronization level. Score = `0.6 × 60.0 + 0.4 × 0 = 36.0`. Note that `60 %` for `high_pct` is `3 / 5` — a valid multiple for a sample size of 5 (the original 3-instance worked example was mathematically impossible since percentages must be multiples of `33.3 %` for `n = 3`).

> The `cascade_risk_index` field is in the canonical schema. It is a placeholder produced by the Phase 3 Liquidity Intelligence extension but is **not yet aggregated into `systemic_risk_score`**; see [01-05-liquidity-domain.md §Open questions — Canonical deferred-work tracker](../conceptual-foundations/01-05-liquidity-domain.md) for the canonical status statement and for the rule that downstream docs must link to it rather than restating the status. The field appears in the JSON so downstream consumers (UI, REST, PAE) have a stable contract to read.

## Appendix B — Complete Indicator, Signal, and SignalKind Manifest

This appendix provides the definitive registry-verified manifest of all **52** indicators, **101 signal-kind declarations** (post-v6.6 — the historical 101 → 100 transition is documented in §B.3's editor's note and §B.2's count row, and the current 100 → 101 add-back reflects the v6.6 `mark_index_spread` registry entry), and 12 SignalKind types in the platform. Counts are authoritative — drawn from `crates/market-analyzer/src/indicators/registry.rs`.

---

### B.1 Complete Indicator Registry (52 entries, 8 groups)

> **52, not 50/51.** The registry contains 52 entries (10 Trend + 7 Momentum + 7 Volume + 6 Volatility + 5 Structure + **5** Regime + 4 Institutional + 8 Derivatives). The "50" count predates v6.6's `mark_index_spread` registry tagging (51) and v6.11's `price_trend_sharpe` (52) — both rows are listed in their group tables below. The canonical count is registry-verified at every commit (`crates/market-analyzer/src/indicators/registry.rs`).

### B.2 Summary Counts

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Registry Entries | **52** (10 Trend + 7 Momentum + 7 Volume + 6 Volatility + 5 Structure + 5 Regime + 4 Institutional + 8 Derivatives) |
| Directional (scoring contributors) | **42** |
| Non-Directional Gates | **10** (`volume`, `rvol`, `atr`, `bbwp`, `hv`, `choppiness`, `funding_rate`, `spread`, `open_interest`, `mark_index_spread`) |
| Indicators Supporting Divergence | **8** (`rsi`, `stochastic`, `chandemo`, `macd`, `obv`, `cmf`, `mfi`, `squeeze`) |
| Total Signal-Kind × Indicator Declarations | **101** (one declaration per `(indicator, SignalKind)` pair; `×N` in the index counts multiplicity *within* a single declaration, e.g. 5 RSI threshold zones). Registry-verified. The earlier "100 → 101" transition reflects the v6.6 `mark_index_spread` registry entry; the historical `101 → 100` reduction is preserved in Appendix B §B.3 editor's note. |
| SignalKind Types | **12** |

**Important:** Divergence companions (e.g., `rsi_divergence`, `macd_divergence`) are **NOT** separate registry entries and produce **NO** separate JSON keys. A divergence is an `IndicatorSignal { kind: Divergence, ... }` emitted on the parent indicator's `signals` array. Eight parent indicators are annotated with `supports_divergence: true` in the registry.

---

### B.3 SignalKind Frequency Table

Canonical counts — registry-verified against `crates/market-analyzer/src/indicators/registry.rs` at `2026-07-16`:

| # | SignalKind | Declarations | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | `Divergence` | **9** | 8 nested on parent (`supports_divergence: true`: `rsi`, `stochastic`, `chandemo`, `macd`, `obv`, `cmf`, `mfi`, `squeeze`) + 1 standalone (`oi_price_divergence`, own registry entry). Price/indicator directional disagreement. |
| 2 | `Crossover` | **9** | Two series cross (e.g., MACD line × signal). |
| 3 | `Threshold` | **26** | Value enters a named zone (e.g., RSI ≥ 70). |
| 4 | `Breakout` | **9** | Price breaks a structural boundary. Includes `RESISTANCE_FLIP_CONFIRMED` / `SUPPORT_FLIP_CONFIRMED` from `support_resistance` (see `04-02-32-support-resistance.md §6`). |
| 5 | `BandTouch` | **4** | Price contacts a channel/band edge. Producers: `donchian`, `keltner`, `bollinger`, `stddev_channel`. |
| 6 | `ZeroLineCross` | **11** | Oscillator crosses its zero/mid line. Producers: `rsi`, `chandemo`, `williams_r`, `awesome_oscillator`, `cci`, `macd`, `cmf`, `force_index`, `linreg_slope`, `zscore`, `oi_delta`. |
| 7 | `CompressionRelease` | **4** | Volatility cycle phase transition (compression/coiling + release/expansion). Producers: `atr`, `bbwp`, `choppiness`, `squeeze`. *(The v2.1 docs-only rename to `VolatilityCycle` never propagated to the registry; v4.0 reverts to the canonical registry name `CompressionRelease`.)* |
| 8 | `LevelTest` | **14** | Price tests a horizontal level. Producers: `donchian`, `keltner`, `vwap`, `anchored_vwap`, `ichimoku`, `stddev_channel`, `volume_profile`, `bollinger`, `fibonacci`, `support_resistance`, `pivot_points`, `smc_fvg`, `smc_order_blocks`, `supertrend`. |
| 9 | `TrendFlip` | **8** | Directional regime reverses. Producers: `supertrend`, `psar`, `adx`, `ichimoku`, `obv`, `aroon`, `smc_structure`, `smc_order_blocks`. |
| 10 | `VolumeClimax` | **2** | Abnormal volume surge. Producers: `volume`, `rvol`. |
| 11 | `StackChange` | **1** | EMA ribbon reorders. Producer: `ema_stack`. |
| 12 | `PatternForming` | **3** | Chart/candlestick pattern detected. Producers: `patterns`, `candlestick`, `smc_liquidity`. |
| | **TOTAL** | **100** | Sum-check: 9+9+26+9+4+11+4+14+8+2+1+3 = 100. |

> The registry is the authoritative source of truth (`crates/market-analyzer/src/indicators/registry.rs`). Any disagreement between this table and the registry is resolved in favor of the registry.

**×N notation.** The `×N` suffix on per-indicator manifest rows (e.g. `PatternForming×2` for `patterns` and `candlestick`) counts **internal event multiplicity within a single declaration**, not declaration count. For example, `patterns` has exactly one `(patterns, PatternForming)` declaration in the registry, but emits multiple PatternForming event subtypes — the `×2` reflects that internal multiplicity. It does **not** mean "2 declarations of `(patterns, PatternForming)`". The 101-declaration total above is the sum of distinct `(indicator, SignalKind)` pairs across all 52 indicators.

---

### B.4 How Divergence Signals Work

Divergence is handled as a **signal on the parent indicator**, not as a separate entry:

1. The parent indicator (e.g., `rsi`) has `supports_divergence: true` and includes `SignalKind::Divergence` in its `signal_types`.
2. When divergence is detected via `DivergenceState`, an `IndicatorSignal { kind: Divergence, direction: Bullish|Bearish, status: Confirmed|Potential, ... }` is pushed into the parent's `signals` array.
3. The parent's `normalized` value and `state_label` are also modulated by the divergence state (e.g., confirmed bullish divergence forces RSI `normalized = 1.0`, `state_label = "OVERSOLD_ACCUMULATION"`).
4. The JSON output nests divergence signals under the parent key — there is never a separate `"rsi_divergence"` key in the indicators map.

```json
{
  "rsi": {
    "raw_value": 28.5,
    "normalized": 1.0,
    "state_label": "OVERSOLD_ACCUMULATION",
    "signals": [
      { "kind": "DIVERGENCE", "direction": "BULLISH", "status": "CONFIRMED",
        "label": "CONFIRMED_BULLISH_DIVERGENCE", "strength": 1.0, "age_bars": 0 },
      { "kind": "THRESHOLD", "direction": "BULLISH", "status": "ACTIVE",
        "label": "OVERSOLD", "strength": 0.0, "age_bars": 0 }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Appendix C — Formal Architectural Vocabulary

*   **Alignment:** The degree of agreement regarding market direction or structure among multiple independent timeframes of a single symbol.
*   **Analytical Feature:** A standardized, quantitative metric processed from raw indicators and signals designed to serve as a reusable analytical block.
*   **Bias:** The dominant directional interpretation of an asset's price vector (e.g., Bullish, Neutral, Bearish).
*   **Confluence:** The intersection and agreement of multiple independent technical indicators or signals within a single timeframe.
*   **Drawdown:** The peak-to-trough decline in capital reserves for a specific trading account or strategy, expressed as a percentage or nominal dollar value.
*   **Engine:** The largest independent functional block within the trading platform, representing an autonomous business domain.
*   **Execution Policy:** A deterministic, user-configured trigger rule evaluated by the Trade Automation Engine to govern order dispatch.
*   **Layer:** An isolated sequential step within an engine's processing pipeline that transforms data to a higher level of abstraction.
*   **Market Instance:** The (symbol, exchange) container owning the ACTIVE fixed-ladder TimeframePipelines (the fastest `[workspace].active_timeframes` slots of the `micro1`…`longterm2` pool, v11.2); the per-(symbol, timeframe) analytical unit is a TimeframePipeline. Canonical glossary: [06-01-api-gateway-contract.md §1.0](../integration-and-api/06-01-api-gateway-contract.md).
*   **Market Phase:** The active stage of an asset within its broader market cycle — 4 phases (`ACCUMULATION`, `MARKUP`, `DISTRIBUTION`, `MARKDOWN`) plus the `UNKNOWN` empty-state sentinel.
*   **Market Regime:** The underlying environmental behavior of an asset, defining the structural context (e.g., `EXPANSION`, `RANGE`).
*   **Matrix:** The structured, immutable output produced by an analytical layer, serving as the interface contract between stages.
*   **Opportunity Score:** A numeric representation from 0 to 100 expressing the density of high-probability entry criteria present in the market.
*   **Price-Trend Sharpe Ratio (v6.11):** The annualized Sharpe ratio of raw price log returns over the trailing 300-bar window (L1 `price_trend_sharpe` indicator, Regime group). It quantifies the relative smoothness and return consistency of the price series on a single timeframe: `mean(ln(c_t/c_{t−1})) ÷ σ(ln(c_t/c_{t−1})) × sqrt((86400/timeframe_secs) × 365)`. A high positive value (e.g. `+2.40`) indicates a highly consistent, low-noise price trend suitable for trend-riding.
*   **Quality-to-Risk Ratio (v6.11):** The setup-efficiency metric on the L6 Advisory Matrix (`quality_to_risk_ratio`): `AnalysisMatrix.market_quality_score ÷ RiskMatrix.overall_risk.score`, both unipolar `[0, 100]`. It tells the trader whether the risk is mathematically justified by the setup's quality — high quality with low risk yields a high ratio (favorable entry environment); low quality with high risk yields a low ratio (avoid). `None` when the risk score is zero.
*   **Risk Score:** A numeric representation from 0 to 100 expressing the structural, technical, and execution dangers inherent in the current market environment, independent of directional bias.
*   **Slippage:** The difference between the targeted execution price of an automation policy and the actual filled price on an exchange.
*   **Trade Readiness:** A classification status indicating whether technical and structural conditions have sufficiently matured to support an entry attempt.
*   **Trend Stability Sharpe (v6.11, removed v6.14):** The annualized Sharpe ratio of the 50-period EMA's logarithmic returns over the trailing 300-bar window. It measured the directional stability of the trend's slope with high-frequency price noise stripped away. **Removed in v6.14** with the `AnalysisMatrix` field, Trend-card badge, and export pair — the L1→L3 traceability-evidence exception was reverted to keep L3's derived state strictly `L3 ← L2`; the L1 `price_trend_sharpe` indicator is now the sole Sharpe family member.
*   **Dimension Score (v6.12):** The 0-100 alignment dimension score each qualitative assessment is bucketed from, carried on the matrix as `AnalysisMatrix.trend_score` / `momentum_score` / `structure_score` / `volatility_score` / `volume_score` — L3-owned numeric companions (the disaggregated siblings of `market_quality_score`), rendered as tinted badges with ▲/▼ deltas on the Analysis panel. The label never disagrees with its score: the label IS the band.
*   **Volatility-to-Spread Ratio (v6.11):** The execution-friction gauge on the L5 `execution_risk` dimension (`volatility_to_spread_ratio`): `ATR(14) ÷ (best ask − best bid)` in raw price units. A high ratio (e.g. `> 10`) means the average candle range is much larger than the transaction cost (favorable for short-term scalping); a low ratio (e.g. `< 1.5`) warns that bid-ask spread friction and slippage will consume potential profits even with a perfect setup.
