# Trading Platform Architecture Specification

**Version:** 11.8 (2026-09-16) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.
**Purpose:** This document defines the high-level, two-dimensional architecture of the complete Trading Platform. It outlines the boundaries, operational responsibilities, layer structures, and interface matrices for the six core engines of the system, providing a structural blueprint for developers, system engineers, and frontend designers.

> **Implementation status (v10.1).** All six engines are implemented: DIE and MME end-to-end, TAE as a setup executor on the unified execution engine (paper default, live Hyperliquid + Bitget dispatch, v10 lifecycle hardening), PME as an informational portfolio mirror, PAE with live analytics + recorded-decision backtest + significance treatment, and BTE with deep-history pipeline replay + DS persistence. See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) §2 for the engine-by-engine reality.

## 1. Architectural Blueprint: The Two-Dimensional Framework

The Trading Platform is designed around a **Two-Dimensional Architectural Framework** that isolates business domains horizontally and analytical transformations vertically. This design guarantees modularity, testability, and deterministic data flow.

|             | Data Infra. (DIE) | Market Monitor (MME) | Trade Auto. (TAE) | Portfolio Mgmt. (PME) | Perf. Analytics (PAE) | Backtesting (BTE) |
| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **LAYER 1** | Raw Data L.       | Metrics L.           | Policy L.         | Position L.           | Trade Anal.           | Archive L.        |
| **LAYER 2** | Market D. L.      | Alignment L.         | Execution L.      | Exposure L.           | Strat. Anal.          | Replay L.         |
| **LAYER 3** | Data Qual.L.      | Analysis L.          |                   | Capital L.            | Risk Anal.            |                   |
| **LAYER 4** | Dist. Layer       | Opp. Layer           |                   | Overview L.           | Perf. Layer           |                   |
| **LAYER 5** |                   | Risk Layer           |                   |                       |                       |
| **LAYER 6** |                   | Decision L.          |                   |                       |                       |
| **LAYER 7** |                   | Overview L.          |                   |                       |                       |

> **MME parallel branch:** Within the Market Monitoring Engine, Layers 4 (Opportunity) and 5 (Risk) are **orthogonal** and execute **in parallel** directly from Layer 3 (Analysis) — neither reads the other. They converge at Layer 6 (Decision). See §2.2.

### 1.1 Horizontal Axis: Specialized Engines
The horizontal axis comprises six decoupled computational engines (DIE, MME, TAE, PME, PAE, BTE). Each engine owns one primary quantitative or transactional domain. They maintain zero shared memory or shared states, communicating only via stable, public APIs and read-only message streams.

### 1.2 Vertical Axis: Sequenced Analytical Layers
Within each engine, the vertical axis dictates the step-by-step transformation of raw, low-level data into highly abstract decision-support vectors. Each step is represented by an isolated **Layer** that consumes the preceding layer's output, applies deterministic calculations, and produces a single, immutable, versioned **Matrix** as its official output contract.

## 2. The Six Core Engines and Layer Specifications

---

### 2.1 Data Infrastructure Engine (DIE)

The Data Infrastructure Engine is responsible for the ingest, normalization, validation, and real-time distribution of exchange data feeds.

```
[Exchange APIs] -> (Raw Data Layer) -> (Market Data Layer) -> (Data Quality Layer) -> (Distribution Layer) -> [To MME]
```

#### Layer 1: Raw Data Layer
*   **Purpose:** Establish and maintain low-level socket and REST connections to external venues.
*   **Processing:** Read raw network frames, manage rate-limiting constraints, handle reconnection protocols, and buffer incoming byte streams.
*   **Output (Raw Data Matrix):** Standardized JSON or binary representations of raw exchange events (ticks, trades, order book steps).

#### Layer 2: Market Data Layer
*   **Purpose:** Transform raw event-based feeds into structured, uniform temporal boundaries.
*   **Processing:** Aggregate trade events and book snapshots into standardized OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) bars across target intervals.
*   **Output (Market Data Matrix):** Uniform, multi-timeframe candle data per symbol (pre-validation, per-layer output; the inter-engine transport name is also Market Data Matrix, but the data here is raw — quality validation applies at L3).
*   **Strict UTC-Alignment Constraint (Zero-Drift Synchronization):** All time-boundary candle aggregations synchronize strictly with the UTC daily clock. The closing instant of any candle aligns to the exact epoch-duration multiple of UTC, computed deterministically as `interval_start = ⌊timestamp_ms / duration_ms⌋ × duration_ms` (so a `micro60` candle closes at `:00.000` of the next minute; a `macro900` candle closes at `:15:00.000`, `:30:00.000`, `:45:00.000`, or `:00:00.000`). Local server system clocks execute continuous NTP polling to maintain local system time drift under $\le 50 \text{ microseconds}$ of UTC. Drift enforcement is implemented in `crates/network-adapters/src/clock_monitor.rs` (spawned as a continuous background task by `crates/execution-daemon/src/main.rs` after engine initialization and before live ingestion, polling NTP every 30 s; configured via the `[clock_monitor]` section of `config.toml`). This prevents timezone, socket, or aggregation-time drift, ensuring local indicator values align exactly with exchange historical benchmarks. See [08-06-clock-monitor.md](../operations-and-compliance/08-06-clock-monitor.md) for the full lifecycle and breach handling.

#### Layer 3: Data Quality Layer
*   **Purpose:** Enforce data integrity and detect stream anomalies.
*   **Processing:** Audit historical sequences for missing bars, parse for stale tick values, filter spikes, and drop out-of-order ticks and count them in `out_of_order_dropped` (late trades on closed candles are never merged retroactively — see 03-01-04-die-layer3-data-quality.md §3).
*   **Output (CandleQualityEnvelope + PipelineReliabilityMetrics):** Sanitized, gap-filled market datasets paired with reliability metrics.

#### Layer 4: Data Distribution Layer
*   **Purpose:** Route verified data streams to downstream system consumers.
*   **Processing:** Manage pub/sub event loops, prioritize routing queues, and minimize dispatch latency.
*   **Output (Distribution Matrix):** High-throughput, real-time `NormalizedCandle` broadcast channel — consumed exclusively by the Candle Aggregator for higher-timeframe rollup. The analytical `MarketSnapshot` channel (which carries indicators, matrices, and telemetry to the MME, UI, and telemetry logger) is an MME L1 artifact — see `03-02-02-mme-layer1-metrics.md §8`.

---

### 2.2 Market Monitoring Engine (MME)

The Market Monitoring Engine transforms standardized market data into multi-timeframe, contextual technical intelligence, isolating trend interpretation, opportunity, and risk.

```
                                                 ┌─> (L4: Opportunity Layer) ─┐
                                                 │                            │
[Market Data] -> (Metrics L.) -> (Alignment L.) -> (Analysis L.) ─┤                            ├─> (L6: Decision L.) -> (L7: Overview L.)
                                                 │                            │
                                                 └─> (L5: Risk Layer) ────────┘
```

Layers 4 and 5 read the Analysis Matrix independently and run in parallel (orthogonal dimensions); they converge only at Layer 6.

#### Layer 1: Metrics Layer
*   **Purpose:** Compute single-timeframe technical metrics and project them across standardized multidimensional context dimensions.
*   **Processing:** Compute technical indicators (EMA, RSI, ATR) and detect single-timeframe technical signals (including price-to-indicator divergences, candlestick patterns, and structural breaks). Project each indicator across its standard Indicator Evaluation Axes (Value, State, Direction, Strength, Market Regime, Confidence, Freshness, Quality) and each signal across its standard Signal Evaluation Axes (Signal Type, Direction, Strength, Confidence, Freshness, Confirmation, Market Regime, Multi-Timeframe Agreement, Risk, Priority). The set of indicators and signals actually evaluated is the **Active Set**, derived from config (registry defaults − global `[activation]` denylist − per-instance `[instances.*.activation]` denylist) — see [03-02-12-mme-configurable-activation.md](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-12-mme-configurable-activation.md).
*   **Output (Metrics Matrix):** Structured `IndicatorEvaluation` and `SignalEvaluation` telemetry objects, along with compiled localized analytical features. Records exactly the enabled data (Active Set); disabled items are absent, never null.

#### Layer 2: Alignment Layer
*   **Purpose:** Evaluate spatial-temporal consensus across multiple time horizons.
*   **Processing:** Calculate alignment indices between the ACTIVE fixed ladder timeframes (the fastest `[workspace].active_timeframes` slots of the `micro1`…`longterm2` pool, v11.2) for trend direction, momentum vectors, and key support/resistance blocks.
*   **Output (Alignment Matrix):** Unified multi-timeframe alignment and structural confluence scores.

#### Layer 3: Analysis Layer
*   **Purpose:** Formulate the core structural interpretation of an asset.
*   **Processing:** Diagnose the dominant trend bias, represented qualitatively as a categorical classification and quantitatively as a continuous Market Bias Score normalized between `-1.0` (absolute bearish) and `+1.0` (absolute bullish). Identify the structural regime (trending vs. ranging), assess the current cycle phase, and evaluate overall trend quality.
*   **Output (Analysis Matrix):** Standardized classifications of the asset's technical environment and directional bias indexes.

#### Layer 4: Opportunity Layer
*   **Purpose:** Identify and score positive market configurations.
*   **Processing:** Evaluate structural setups (breakout, continuation, pullback, mean-reversion, reversal, liquidity-squeeze, scalp) to identify and score positive market configurations on a 0–100 scale, independent of trade direction or execution parameters. Scoring is strategy-agnostic and direction-neutral; entry-specific synthesis lives at the Decision Layer.
*   **Output (Opportunity Matrix):** Strategy-agnostic opportunity classifications with associated confidence scores (0-100).

#### Layer 5: Risk Layer
*   **Purpose:** Quantify environmental danger and exposure conditions, independent of direction.
*   **Processing:** Compute localized volatility parameters, measure book liquidity depth, evaluate proximity to major invalidation barriers, and assess signal divergence.
*   **Output (Risk Matrix):** Comprehensive risk indices across **eight unipolar danger sub-dimensions** (`market_risk`, `volatility_risk`, `execution_liquidity_risk`, `structure_risk`, `momentum_risk`, `signal_risk`, `execution_risk`, `cascade_risk`) plus `overall_risk`. *The previously-listed 8th sub-dimension was historically referred to as both "correlation risk" and "reward risk" — both terms are stale references to the same retired concept. The dimension was removed in the institutional redesign; its semantic successor is `entry_danger` (renamed from `risk_favorability`) in the Decision Matrix, and correlated-downside danger is now captured by the cross-symbol `systemic_risk_score` at L7 (see [Overview Matrix §4](../matrices/02-09-overview-matrix.md)).*

#### Layer 6: Decision Layer
*   **Purpose:** Synthesize bias, opportunity, and risk into strategic decision support.
*   **Processing:** Grade overall trade readiness, determine strategy-compatibility scores, and map dynamic protection (stop-loss percentage distance) and target zones.
*   **Output (Decision Matrix):** High-value tactical blueprints containing scenario pathways and structural invalidation parameters.

#### Layer 7: Overview Layer
*   **Purpose:** Synthesize cross-symbol market data into global systemic context.
*   **Processing:** Measure market-wide breadth vectors, compile leaderboards of asset strength/weakness, and aggregate risk variables into a single systemic risk score.
*   **Output (Overview Matrix):** Global market intelligence summaries used for portfolio-level asset allocation.

### 2.3 Trade Automation Engine (TAE)

> **Implementation status (v10.1).** **Implemented** — the TAE is a setup executor that consumes the MME's top setup directly and manages the trade lifecycle (entry limit at zone midpoint → TP/SL bracket → LEVEL/SIGNAL invalidation) through the unified execution engine; the `TradeAutomationDashboard` fetches live state via `/api/instances/:id/automation`. See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) §2.3.

The Trade Automation Engine evaluates user-defined execution rules and coordinates order execution with external venues.

```
[MME Decision] -> (Setup Executor) -> (Execution Layer) -> [Paper / Live Execution Backend]
```

#### Layer 1: Policy Layer
*   **Purpose:** Evaluate real-time market intelligence against programmable automation rules.
*   **Processing:** Map incoming symbol-specific Decision Matrices to active user configurations, validate trigger boundaries, and check symbol-level stances (Active, Close Only, Avoid).
*   **Output (Policy Matrix):** Active policy directives containing target direction, entry parameters, and protective criteria.

#### Layer 2: Execution Layer

> **Implementation status (v10.1).** The Execution Layer is implemented: the unified execution engine routes through the `ExecutionBackend` trait — `PaperSimulation` by default, `LiveBroker` (Hyperliquid) and `BitgetLiveBroker` (Bitget) in live mode — with the same fees/slippage/funding/PnL accounting in both modes. The diagrams below describe the implemented system.

*   **Purpose:** Route transactional orders and manage trade lifecycles on the configured execution venue. The current implementation routes through the unified execution engine (`crates/portfolio-supervisor/src/execution/engine.rs`) to the paper simulation matching engine (`crates/portfolio-supervisor/src/execution/backend.rs::PaperSimulation`), or to the live venue adapters (`LiveBroker`, `BitgetLiveBroker`) in live mode.
*   **Processing:** Execute the Allocation Sizing Protocol upon trade entry validation. Query the execution engine for current equity and the instance's configured `allocation_pct` (1–100 %, default 10 %). Calculate the position notional and order size (v8.2 portfolio-share model):
    $$\text{notional} = \frac{\text{equity} \times \text{allocation\_pct}}{100}, \qquad \text{size\_units} = \frac{\text{notional}}{\text{entry\_price}}$$
    Construct order packets, apply slippage filters against real-time order books, dispatch execution messages to the target venue (live or paper), and track order execution states. The canonical sizing + projection math lives in `crates/portfolio-supervisor/src/setup_executor.rs::project` (consumed by the setup executor — see [03-03-01-tae-overview-spec.md §5](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-01-tae-overview-spec.md)).
*   **Output (Execution Matrix):** Structured database of outstanding, filled, modified, and cancelled orders.

---

### 2.4 Portfolio Management Engine (PME)

> **Implementation status (v10.1).** **Implemented (informational)** — the PME maintains the safety-state ladder (WARN / CAUTIOUS / SUSPENDED / DRAWDOWN_STOP) as a read-only status consumed by the TAE setup executor's soft gate; `safety.rs` plus the four pure layer modules are wired in `execution-daemon`, and the `PortfolioDashboard` fetches live state via `/api/instances/:id/portfolio` and `/api/instances/:id/safety`. See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) §2.4.

The Portfolio Management Engine manages capital safety boundaries, tracks asset exposures, and maintains active ledger accounts.

```
[Fills & Fails] -> (Position Layer) -> (Exposure Layer) -> (Capital Layer) -> (Overview Layer) -> [TAE / UI]
```

#### Layer 1: Position Layer
*   **Purpose:** Track active open positions and calculate live valuation states.
*   **Processing:** Update average entry prices, monitor mark-to-market valuations, compute active unrealized PnL, and coordinate dynamic stop adjustments with external fills.
*   **Output (Position Matrix):** Directory of active positions with high-frequency valuation metrics.

#### Layer 2: Exposure Layer
*   **Purpose:** Group and limit active capital allocations across correlated boundaries.
*   **Processing:** Aggregate gross and net allocations across symbols, sectors, and correlated currency assets to prevent concentration risk.
*   **Output (Exposure Matrix):** Consolidated risk allocation and concentration metrics.

#### Layer 3: Capital Layer
*   **Purpose:** Monitor overall account solvency and balance distributions.
*   **Processing:** Manage available balances, track margin usage, evaluate leverage limits, and record fee impacts.
*   **Output (Capital Matrix):** High-frequency balance sheet of active and available capital.

#### Layer 4: Overview Layer
*   **Purpose:** Consolidate active position, exposure, and capital matrices into a unified ledger and report account-level safety state.
*   **Processing:** Synthesize child matrices to track account health. Maintain the safety-state ladder (WARN / CAUTIOUS / SUSPENDED / DRAWDOWN_STOP) from the portfolio-wide drawdown and consecutive-loss counters. The ladder is read-only: the TAE setup executor's soft gate blocks new entries in `DRAWDOWN_STOP` / `SUSPENDED`; no veto, no stance override.
*   **Output (PortfolioOverviewMatrix):** The master financial state ledger of the trading account.

---

### 2.5 Performance Analytics Engine (PAE)

> **Implementation status (v10.1).** **Implemented** — the PAE backend (stats compiler, strategy/risk analytics, performance layer, strategy optimizer) plus the BTE historical + recorded runners with the full NHST treatment (t-test, 10k Monte Carlo, α = 0.05, edge verdict); the `PerformanceDashboard` fetches live data including the real backtest tab (`POST /api/backtest/run`). See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) §2.5.

The Performance Analytics Engine evaluates historical trading records to isolate strategy efficacy and identify system drag.

```
[Historical Ledgers] -> (Trade Analytics L.) -> (Strategy Analytics L.) -> (Risk Analytics L.) -> (Performance L.)
```

#### Layer 1: Trade Analytics Layer
*   **Purpose:** Reconstruct completed trading events.
*   **Processing:** Extract entry and exit timestamps, calculate exact net holding times, parse execution slippage values, and measure peak trade deviations (MFE, MAE).
*   **Output (Trade Analytics Matrix):** Normalized ledger of reconstructed, closed trades.

#### Layer 2: Strategy Analytics Layer
*   **Purpose:** Group and evaluate closed trade performance segmented by originating Execution Policy, calculating mathematical significance against random market noise.
*   **Processing:** Parse trade performance by policy ID. Calculate standard win rates, gross profit factors, trade expectancy, and average win/loss ratios. Perform Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) against the baseline hypothesis ($H_0$) that strategy returns are a product of random chance: compute the T-Statistic and P-Value of the strategy's return distribution, and run Monte Carlo sign-randomized baseline samples (each trade's PnL multiplied by a fair-coin ±1) to output the empirical significance probability ($p_{mc}$).
*   **Output (Strategy Analytics Matrix):** Performance metrics and statistical significance parameters segmented by strategy and policy type.

#### Layer 3: Risk Analytics Layer
*   **Purpose:** Evaluate historical drawdown patterns and risk-adjusted metrics.
*   **Processing:** Track equity drawdowns, evaluate recovery timelines, and compute normalized risk-adjusted performance values (Sharpe, Sortino, Ulcer Index).
*   **Output (Risk Analytics Matrix):** Historical risk metrics representing overall system safety.

#### Layer 4: Performance Layer
*   **Purpose:** Correlate performance against historical market conditions.
*   **Processing:** Cross-reference strategy results with recorded market regimes to map compatibility and generate metric-driven optimization inputs.
*   **Output (Performance Matrix):** The complete performance and regime compatibility profile of the trading system.

## 3. Communication Model and Decoupling Boundaries

Engines maintain high operational efficiency by communicating through strictly defined, contract-based boundaries.

> **Channel ownership note.** The `[NormalizedCandle]` edge from DIE is the raw OHLCV transport (DIE L4 → Candle Aggregator). The `[MarketSnapshot]` edge from MME is the analytical envelope (MME L1 → L2–L7, frontend WebSocket, telemetry logger). See `03-01-05-die-layer4-data-distribution.md` and `03-02-02-mme-layer1-metrics.md §8`. The `[Decision Matrix]` edge from MME to TAE is the policy-level handoff; the `[Capital M.]` edge from PME to TAE is the in-process sizing query.

### 3.1 Unidirectional Stream Cascade
The platform prohibits bidirectional dependency chains. Execution details do not influence market interpretation; instead, normalized telemetry cascades forward. If a downstream engine requires information from an upstream engine, it subscribes to that engine's published, read-only matrix stream.

### 3.2 Decoupled API Interfaces
Engines interact using two communication methods:
1.  **Publish/Subscribe (Event Stream):** Used for real-time, continuous streams of data (such as sending ticks from DIE, decision matrices from MME, or position valuations from PME).
2.  **Request/Response (Service Call):** Used for single operations or specific state queries (such as dispatching an order packet or retrieving portfolio parameters).

### 3.3 Decoupled Producer/Consumer
Engines must run in separate memory structures or isolated processes. No engine is permitted to query another engine's private database tables or manipulate its internal runtime variables. All exchange of information is governed strictly by the public matrices defined.

> **Documented exception: TAE–PME in-process sizing query.** The TAE Execution Layer and the PME Capital Layer share state via an in-process `tokio::sync::RwLock` over the in-memory `Capital Matrix` (no IPC, no SQLite round-trip on the sizing hot path). This is a deliberate latency-driven compromise — the Position Sizing Protocol must complete in microseconds, which is incompatible with cross-process RPC or DB round-trips. See [03-03-03-tae-layer2-execution.md §2.0](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-03-tae-layer2-execution.md) for the synchronization contract. Migration to out-of-process isolation is on the post-v2.2 roadmap.

### 3.4 Documented Exception: MME L4 / L5 Multi-Source Input

Both MME Layer 4 (Opportunity) and Layer 5 (Risk) consume the extension layers L1.5/L2.5 (fractional layers of MME) — specifically, the L1.5 `LiquidityFlow` and L2.5 `LiquidationClusterMatrix` (Liquidity Phase 0-4 Liquidity Intelligence extension):

- **L4** reads `cascade_state` (L1.5) and `cascade_asymmetry` (L2.5) for the `LiquiditySqueeze` opportunity precondition only; all other opportunity types read only L3 + L1.
- **L5** reads `cascade_intensity` (L1.5) and `cascade_asymmetry` (L2.5) for the `cascade_risk` sub-dimension (the 8th unipolar danger dimension).

The unidirectional invariant is preserved: L2.5 does not read from L4 or L5; L4 and L5 remain orthogonal (neither reads the other's matrix); L5 → L6 remains unidirectional. See [03-02-11-mme-liquidity-extension.md](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-11-mme-liquidity-extension.md) for the full cascade invariant.

## 4. Platform Serialization and Dual-Execution Architecture (GUI vs. CLI)

The platform enforces absolute system portability and reproducibility. Any strategy, configuration profile, or portfolio state established within the graphical interface can be serialized and run headlessly in the cloud.

### 4.1 Configuration Portability Principle
To ensure that an execution profile developed on a local setup runs identically in a remote headless environment, all system configurations are serializable. The platform surfaces configuration through three distinct contracts:

* **Runtime TOML** — `config.toml` at the workspace root, read by `config-models::load_config()`. This is the operator-facing configuration file: all engine knobs, indicator periods, liquidity thresholds, and execution policies live here. Served to the frontend via `GET /api/config`.
* **Export JSON** — The legacy wire format for configuration portability between engine instances. Superseded by TOML at v5.0 and **removed** — `load_config()` reads `config.toml` only.
* **DB-stored profiles** — Named decision/risk profiles stored in the `decision_profiles` table, applied per-instance via the `[instances.*.profile]` key. These are the operational overrides that sit on top of the global config.

### 4.2 GUI Mode (Exploration and Research)
*   **Purpose:** The main interface for interactive development, validation, and optimization of trading setups.
*   **Operation:** Boots all five engines with full graphical visualization modules. Users load assets, visualize indicator axes, paper-trade live streams to prove a statistical edge (alpha), adjust safety guidelines, and export the finalized environment payload.

### 4.3 CLI Mode (Terminal Monitor — `--mode cli`)
*   **Purpose:** Low-overhead terminal monitoring for cloud environments (v7.2). The retired
    `setup` subcommand and `--mode headless` were replaced by an interactive launch prompt
    (exchange, currency, instances with per-TF durations, pre-filled from `config.toml`).
*   **Operation:** Boots the DIE/MME pipelines, session pinned to **observe** (no orders ever
    dispatched — paper/live parity is planned), and renders the same L7 overview the dashboard
    shows as box-drawing terminal tables, redrawn every `--interval` seconds. `--save` enables
    snapshot-export JSON dumps. No HTTP server is bound — lighter than web mode, same SQLite
    `telemetry.db`.
*   **Boundaries:** Currently observe-only. Config and instances persist via the normal
    registry/`save_workspace` path, so the GUI can adopt the same deployment later.

### 4.4 Shared Persistence & Retroactive Visualization
Both modes write metrics, signals, orders, and execution events to a shared SQL/Time-Series database.
*   During active CLI headless operation, all transactional and analytical matrices are persisted in real time.
*   At any later point, the operator can boot the GUI application. The GUI reads these persisted records from the database, allowing the **Performance Analytics Engine (PAE)** to run retroactive trade reconstructions, significance tests ($P$-Values, $t$-statistics), and performance evaluations of the cloud-running strategy.

> **Matrix invariance.** The CLI mode emits the **same** matrices as the GUI mode — the WebSocket `MarketSnapshot` envelope carries the full cascade (Metrics → Alignment → Analysis → Opportunity → Risk → Decision), and the Overview Matrix is broadcast on a separate channel. The CLI/GUI split is purely about the rendering / operator surface; the matrix contract is invariant across modes.

> **Operational setup for cloud + local GUI.** When the CLI engine runs headlessly in the cloud (VPS, container, or remote server), the SQLite database (`./telemetry.db`) is local to that instance. The local GUI accesses the engine via **SSH port-forwarding** — e.g. `ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 user@cloud-host` so the local browser sees `http://127.0.0.1:3000` as the engine's API. Alternatively, the operator can run a local engine instance with a synced copy of `telemetry.db` (via `rsync`, `scp`, or a cloud-synced volume like `rclone`) and point the local engine at the synced DB. The platform assumes one of these two operational setups when running in cloud-headless mode.

## 5. End-to-End Operational Flow

To illustrate the complete pipeline in practice, below is the sequence of events that occurs when a market movement triggers a trade and is subsequently logged by the analytics engine:

1.  **Ingest:** A rapid tick update occurs on the BTCUSDT exchange. The Data Infrastructure Engine (DIE) ingests the event via the *Raw Data Layer*, packages it as standard OHLCV data in the *Market Data Layer*, validates it in the *Data Quality Layer*, and the *Distribution Layer* publishes the validated `NormalizedCandle` to the Candle Aggregator for higher-timeframe rollup. The **Market Monitoring Engine (MME L1)** consumes the completed candle, builds the `MarketSnapshot` (containing indicators, signals, and the full analytical cascade), and publishes it over the `MarketSnapshot` broadcast channel — fanning it out to MME L2–L7, the UI, and the telemetry logger (see `03-02-02-mme-layer1-metrics.md §8`).
2.  **Telemetry:** The Market Monitoring Engine (MME) receives the update. The *Metrics Layer* recalculates indicators and detects signals, immediately projecting them onto their respective multi-dimensional Evaluation Axes (e.g., extracting State, Direction, Strength, and Quality) and updating the **Metrics Matrix**.
3.  **Consensus:** The *Alignment Layer* checks for trend agreement across the ACTIVE fixed ladder time horizons (the fastest `[workspace].active_timeframes` slots of the `micro1`…`longterm2` pool, v11.2), updating the **Alignment Matrix**.
4.  **Diagnosis:** The *Analysis Layer* confirms a transition to a `TRENDING_BULL` regime under a `STRONG_BULLISH` bias (with a `Market Bias Score: +0.82`), updating the **Analysis Matrix**.
5.  **Opportunity:** The *Opportunity Layer* detects a high-probability breakout setup and logs an `Opportunity Score: 85` in the **Opportunity Matrix**.
6.  **Risk:** The *Risk Layer* consumes the Analysis Matrix (L3) and the underlying indicator map — running in parallel with the Opportunity Layer (L4) and independent of the Opportunity Matrix — assesses close proximity to major support, and logs a low `Overall Risk Score: 28` in the **Risk Matrix**. The Risk Matrix reads Analysis Matrix fields such as `market_quality` (L3) but does *not* consume the L4 Opportunity Matrix itself.
7.  **Decision:** The *Decision Layer* synthesizes these matrices, sets *Trade Readiness* to `READY`, and logs a structural invalidation target and calculated `stop_loss_distance_pct: 1.5` in the **Decision Matrix**.
8.  **Trigger:** The Trade Automation Engine (TAE) receives this decision snapshot. The *Policy Layer* identifies that this state satisfies an active long breakout policy and logs an entry command in the **Policy Matrix**.
9.  **Routing:** The *Execution Layer* reads current equity from the engine ledger, looks up the instance's `allocation_pct` (1–100 %), runs the Allocation Sizing Protocol to calculate the position notional ($\text{notional} = \text{equity} \times \text{allocation\_pct} / 100$), routes the buy order to the live exchange API, and records the event in the **Execution Matrix**.
10.  **Supervision:** The Portfolio Management Engine (PME) receives the execution confirmation. The *Position Layer* initializes a new open position in the **Position Matrix**. The *Exposure Layer* recalculates directional risk, the *Capital Layer* locks margin, and the *Overview Layer* updates the account's master balance vector, running continuous safety checks to verify that the portfolio-wide drawdown ceiling has not been breached and updating the safety-state ladder consumed by the TAE soft entry gate.
11. **Analysis:** Upon a subsequent exit trigger, the trade is closed. The Performance Analytics Engine (PAE) imports the closed log into the *Trade Analytics Layer*, calculates performance metrics and runs statistical significance calculations (P-Value, T-Stat, Monte Carlo sign-randomization) in the *Strategy Analytics Layer*, measures drawdown impact in the *Risk Analytics Layer*, and updates the *Performance Matrix* to refine the strategy-to-regime compatibility maps. If the trade was run headlessly via CLI Mode, these entries are persisted to the database; the operator boots the GUI retroactively to display and analyze these metrics.

## 6. Hybrid Memory and Math Architecture (DOD vs. OOP)

> **Target Architecture (Not Yet Implemented).** This section specifies a planned execution model. It does **not** reflect the current implementation, which computes most indicators in `rust_decimal::Decimal` over `VecDeque` buffers, carries telemetry in a `HashMap`-keyed `MarketSnapshot` (with `Decimal` OHLCV), distributes it over Tokio `broadcast` channels as cloned structs, and performs position sizing in `f64` (`crates/portfolio-supervisor/src/risk_calculator.rs`). The design below is the target to migrate toward; it is recorded here so the intended boundary is unambiguous.

To achieve microsecond-level analytical throughput without sacrificing penny-perfect financial safety, the platform draws a strict boundary between two execution models.

### 6.1 The Hot Path — Data-Oriented Design (`f64` / `f32` primitives)

Scope: **DIE ingestion + MME Layers 1–5.**

- Volatile ticks, order-book deltas, and the 52 indicator arrays are packed into cache-aligned, contiguous memory blocks using a **Structure of Arrays (SoA)** layout.
- Rolling histories live in **pre-allocated arena buffers / object pools**, reclaimed rather than freed, to eliminate heap fragmentation and allocator pauses on the analytical loop.
- Calculations run on native floating-point primitives so the compiler can **auto-vectorize (SIMD, AVX/SSE)** and drive hardware FPUs directly.
- Indicator lookup avoids string hashing: the metrics frame is a flat, enum-indexed array (`[IndicatorEvaluation; 51]`) rather than a `HashMap<String, …>`.

### 6.2 The Cold Path — OOP / Domain-Driven Design (`Decimal` precision)

Scope: **TAE, PME, and the relational database.**

- Order routing, position-ledger balancing, margin allocation, and fee accrual use 128-bit fixed-point decimals (`rust_decimal::Decimal`) to prevent rounding drift and exchange rejections.
- Domain objects (Order, Position, Portfolio) encapsulate invariants and are the single source of truth for account state.

### 6.3 The Type-Boundary Handoff

The transition occurs at **MME Layer 6 (Decision Support)**:

1. Layer 6 receives fast, raw `f64` analytics and resolves them into trade readiness.
2. It emits the **Decision Matrix** carrying the stop-loss distance as a raw `f64` — `stop_loss_distance_pct` (e.g. `1.5`, meaning 1.5%).
3. The **TAE Execution Layer** pulls that `f64`, pulls **available margin** ($E$) from the PME Capital Matrix as a `Decimal`, and safely converts the float to `Decimal` at the entry boundary before executing the Position Sizing Protocol with transactional precision:

   ```rust
   // Type-boundary conversion (v8.2 allocation sizing)
   let allocation = Decimal::from_f64_retain(allocation_pct / 100.0)?; // 10.0 → 0.10
   let notional   = equity * allocation;                                // all Decimal
   let size       = notional / entry_price;                             // position units
   ```

   Equivalently, $\text{notional} = \text{equity} \times \text{allocation\_pct} / 100$ with `allocation_pct` ∈ 1–100 (the raw user-facing percent; per-instance override; the sum of all instance allocations is validated ≤ 100 %). The stop-loss level does not size the position — it defines the risk budget and invalidation level.

   > **Variable-naming hazard (historical).** The pre-v8.2 formula used `risk_per_trade_pct` in a stop-distance-scaled size (`size = (equity × risk_fraction) / stop_distance`) — a naming hazard where raw-percent vs fraction confusion caused 100× over-sizing. v8.2 removes the stop-distance scaling entirely: the size is the allocated portfolio share.
