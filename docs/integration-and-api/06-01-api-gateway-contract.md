# API Gateway Contract

**Version:** 11.3 (2026-09-16) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.
**Status:** Approved
**Purpose:** This document specifies the complete REST and WebSocket API surface of the Trading Platform — routes, request/response payloads, JSON-RPC 2.0 conventions, HTTP status codes, error envelope, and serialization rules.

---

## 1. Transport & Addressing

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Framework | Axum (Rust) on a Tokio runtime |
| Base URL | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` by default — **per-folder configurable** via `[server]` in `config.toml`, `PLATFORM_PORT`/`PLATFORM_BIND` env, or `--port`/`--bind` flags (flag > env > config > default). Loopback-only by default (K1); each folder runs an isolated session. **v11.3 smart port**: when the resolved port is busy, the daemon probes +1 steps (`[server] auto_fallback = true`, `port_fallback_range = 20`), serves the first free port, prints requested + actual, and publishes the resolved endpoint to `.server.port` (removed on graceful shutdown; `manage.sh status` reads it). CORS origins are computed from the ACTUAL port |
| Authentication | **Single-operator local deployment.** The Trading Platform is built for a single operator and their team: one workspace, one operator identity (`operator_id = "local"`), no per-route authentication, no caller-supplied identity, and no multi-client model. Every audit event (`risk_control_events.operator_id`, see [`06-02-database-schema-spec.md §3.10`](06-02-database-schema-spec.md)) and WebSocket control frame carries `operator_id = "local"`. |
| Static assets | `ui/dist/` served via `tower_http::services::ServeDir` |
| Origin allowlist (K1) | Built at boot from the resolved bind/port (`http://{bind}:{port}`, `http://127.0.0.1:{port}`, `http://localhost:{port}`) plus the Vite dev origins (`127.0.0.1:5173`, `localhost:5173`); any other origin is refused by CORS and the cross-site middleware |

### 1.0 Canonical glossary (Market Instance identifier)

Throughout this API and the corpus, three names refer to the same identifier:

| Surface | Identifier name | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| API query parameter / response field | `instance_id` | `?instance_id=BTC-USDT@Hyperliquid` |
| SQLite schema column | `pair_key` | `connection_quality_samples.pair_key` |
| Dashboard UI label | "Active pair" / "Market Instance" | "BTC-USDT (Hyperliquid)" |

All three denote the same runtime container — the **Market Instance**: a `(symbol, exchange)` pair (`pair_key` form: `BTC-USDT@Hyperliquid` or just `BTC-USDT` when exchange is unambiguous) on a single venue, owning the ACTIVE **TimeframePipelines** — one per slot of the fixed ten-slot pool, i.e. the fastest `[workspace].active_timeframes` (1..=10, default 5) slots (v11.2) — each with its own analyzer pipeline, telemetry stream, connection-quality tracker, and risk profile. The canonical identifier format on the wire is the **unified internal symbol** (e.g. `BTC-USDT`), with the exchange implied by the runtime configuration; `pair_key` extends it to `<symbol>@<exchange>` for unambiguous DB joins.

> **TimeframePipeline.** The per-`(symbol, timeframe)` analytical unit owned by a Market Instance — one pipeline per fixed ladder slot (`micro1`…`longterm2`; 1/3/5/15/30/60/180/300/900/3600 s — not operator-configurable), each running its own ingestion → indicator → matrix cascade. Per-timeframe telemetry and matrices are always scoped `instance_id × timeframe_secs` (see §2.3).

> **Cross-references.** This glossary is the single source of truth for the three names. Docs that previously used the three names interchangeably (e.g. `/api/connection-quality` formerly mixing `instance_id` and `pair_key`) now point here for resolution.

### 1.1 HTTP status codes and error envelope

Every response uses one of the following status codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200 OK` | Successful read or idempotent mutation |
| `201 Created` | New resource persisted (infrequent in current release) |
| `204 No Content` | Successful mutation, no body |
| `400 Bad Request` | JSON parse error, missing required field, malformed value |
| `404 Not Found` | Unknown resource (unknown `instance_id`, unknown pair_key, etc.) |
| `409 Conflict` | State conflict (e.g. duplicate symbol). Instances in lifecycle `PAUSED` state accept reconfiguration — the pipeline stays alive; Gate 0 blocks only new entries |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Semantic validation failure (e.g. operator override while veto condition still active) |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unhandled server-side failure |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | Engine not yet initialized, exchange connectivity down |

> **Error envelope (audit 2026-08-18).** The JSON envelope shown below is the **intended** contract; the current release returns **plain-text bodies with HTTP status codes** from most handlers (e.g. `404 "Instance not found"`), and unknown `/api/*` paths fall through to the static-asset handler's plain-text 404. Clients must branch on the HTTP status code; the envelope ships in a later release:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INSTANCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "No instance exists for id 42",
    "details": {},
    "request_id": "9c1f-…-…",
    "documentation_url": "/api/docs/errors/INSTANCE_NOT_FOUND"
  }
}
```

`code` is a stable SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE identifier — clients should branch on `code`, not on `message`. `details` is a per-error object (e.g. `{ "field": "limit", "value": 5000, "max": 1000 }`). `request_id` is the same UUID logged server-side; quote it in support requests.

### 1.2 WebSocket error frames

> **v11.3 multi-tab viewers**: every browser tab opens its own socket set (no cross-tab ownership). `MAX_WS_CONNECTIONS` = 256; the global HTTP rate limiter is 60 req/s (1 s sliding window) — sized for concurrent tabs (each tab polls its own overview/instances cycle).

WebSocket close codes follow the engine protocol; the engine never sends an error JSON-RPC frame on `/ws` (only notifications — see §3). When the underlying WebSocket cannot complete its handshake (`/ws` upgraded returns an error), the HTTP body uses the same JSON error envelope as §1.1.

---

## 2. REST API Reference

> **Per-instance matrices via WebSocket only.** The Decision Matrix, Analysis Matrix, Opportunity Matrix, Risk Matrix, and other per-Market-Instance MME outputs are delivered exclusively via the WebSocket envelope (`/ws`) — there is no per-matrix REST endpoint, because these matrices update on every completed candle and a polling REST surface would stale. Use `/ws?symbol=…&timeframe_secs=…` for live access; use `/api/history?symbol=…&timeframe_secs=…` for replay. **Global aggregations (Overview Matrix) are served over REST** at `GET /api/overview` (polled by the dashboard every 3 s) — they are *not* WS-only. The aggregate carries `low_coverage` as a **top-level** field (`bool`, default `false` — `true` when fewer than 3 symbols are active (`active_symbols.len() < 3`); schema in [`02-09-overview-matrix.md §2.1`](../matrices/02-09-overview-matrix.md)). As of v6.10.3 the Overview Matrix additionally carries `alignment_distribution` (`map<string, u32>`), `alignment_consensus_index` (`f64`, [-100, 100]), and `multi_tf_agreement_pct` (`f64`, [0, 100]) — see [`02-09-overview-matrix.md §3.5`](../matrices/02-09-overview-matrix.md) and the per-asset `AssetRank.mtf_score` / `mtf_label` columns in [`02-09-overview-matrix.md §2.2`](../matrices/02-09-overview-matrix.md).

### 2.1 Session Management

| Method | Path | Request | Response |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/session/status` | — | `{ active: bool, currency: string, exchange: string, instance_count: u32, mode?: "observe"\|"paper"\|"live", capital?: number }` — `mode` + `capital` are the session defaults (the frontend reads `data.active`; corrected 2026-08-17) |
| `POST` | `/api/session/init` | `{ exchange: "Hyperliquid"\|"Bitget", currency: "USDT"\|"USDC", mode?: "observe"\|"paper"\|"live", initial_capital_usd?: number }` — `mode` + `initial_capital_usd` are the session defaults for instances created during the session. `observe` = monitoring only (no orders), `live` requires an active API key for the chosen exchange (otherwise `400` with a clear message). | `{ success: bool, message: string, mode?: string, capital?: number }` |
| `POST` | `/api/session/quit` | — | `200 OK` + JSON (cleanup result) → cleans all instances (corrected 2026-08-17 — the handler returns `200` with a body, not `204`) |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions` | — | `{ sessions: [...] }` — persisted sessions, newest first (v10) |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/:id/analytics` | — | `{ session_id, counts, stats }` — session-scoped PAE payloads (v10) |
| `GET` | `/api/analytics/comparison` | — | `{ rows: [...] }` — sessions + backtest runs side by side (v10) |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/:id/input_bars` | `?symbol=&timeframe_secs=` | `{ run_id, bars: [...] }` — the exact input candles a run consumed (v10) |

### 2.2 Configuration

| Method | Path | Request | Response |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/config` | — | `{ api_key_configured: bool, symbols: string[], candles, indicators, instances, indicator_registry, api_failover, active_timeframes, slow_timeframe?, macro_timeframe? }` — the full `AppConfig` surface including the `[api_failover]` block (see §2.2.1 below). v7.2 added `slow_timeframe` / `macro_timeframe` (the then-configurable ladder durations); since v11.1 the ladder is FIXED — those legacy fields are still echoed for backward compatibility, but the Launch Setup wizard and the registry both derive from the fixed 10-slot ladder (`tf_ladder_defaults()` = `FIXED_TF_LADDER`). **v11.2 adds `active_timeframes`** (1..=10, default 5 — the ACTIVE count over the fixed pool; see [01-04 §2](../conceptual-foundations/01-04-timeframe-model.md)). v7.3 adds the engine-settings blocks the TAE/PME/PAE **Settings** tabs render: `liquidity`, `minimal_tae`, `analytics`, `risk_limits`, `safety`, `fees`, `leverage`, `execution`, `scoring`. v7.4 adds `activation` (workspace indicator/signal activation defaults) — and the settings blocks are **editable** via `POST /api/config` (see below), no longer read-only. |
| `POST` | `/api/config` | The `GET /api/config` response body (partial update) | `200 OK` on success. The operator-editable groups (`candles`, `indicators`, `instances`, `api_failover`, `active_timeframes` (v11.2 — validated 1..=10, `400` otherwise), and since v7.4 `minimal_tae`, `safety`, `risk_limits`, `analytics`, `scoring`, `execution`, `fees`, `leverage`, `activation`) are merged into the currently loaded workspace config and persisted to `config.toml` (platform sections preserved via `save_workspace`); `config_version` increments on every accepted save. The body does **not** require `id`/`name` — the read-only fields echoed by GET (`api_key_configured`, `symbols`, `indicator_registry`) are accepted and ignored. v7.4: M8-style range validation rejects out-of-range engine-settings values with `400` + a message; when any engine-settings section is present, all running instances are **recharged live** after the save (idempotent; failures logged, never fatal). The v11.2 `active_timeframes` save rides the same recharge path — running instances rebuild their pipelines to the new fastest-N ACTIVE ladder. `500 Internal Server Error` if `config.toml` cannot be written. |

#### 2.2.1 `[api_failover]` configuration

The `[workspace.api_failover]` TOML block (surfaced as `api_failover` in both the `GET` response and the `POST` merge) tunes the derivatives-data pollers' tolerance for REST failures:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_retries_per_call` | `u32` | `5` | Per-call retry budget for the derivatives-data pollers. Carried for operator visibility; reserved for per-call retry wiring. |
| `retry_delay_seconds` | `u32` | `30` | Backoff between retry attempts. Carried for operator visibility; reserved for per-call retry wiring. |
| `max_consecutive_failures` | `u32` | `30` | **Consumed by the Hyperliquid derivatives poller**: after this many consecutive REST failures the poller is permanently disabled for the process lifetime. |

Defaults are applied via `#[serde(default)]` in `crates/config-models/src/models.rs::ApiFailoverConfig`; an absent block behaves identically to the defaults.
| `GET` | `/api/rules` | — | `{ content: string }` (reads `docs/engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-09-mme-indicators-guide.md`). |
| `POST` | `/api/rules` | `{ content: string }` | Writes indicator guide. |

### 2.3 History & Monitor

| Method | Path | Params | Response |
|--------|------|--------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/history` | `symbol`, `timeframe_secs`, `limit` (default `100`, max `1000`) | `{ symbol, prices[], candles[], indicator_history, clusters?, volume_profiles?, liquidity_flows? }` — see below for the exact `indicator_history` shape. |

The response shape is:

```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "prices": ["64000.00"],
  "candles": [
    { "time": 1755090600000, "open": "64000.00", "high": "64100.00",
      "low": "63950.00", "close": "64050.00", "volume": "12.5",
      "reconstructed": "SYNTHETIC" }
  ],
  "indicator_history": {
    "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
    "timeframe_secs": 60,
    "times": [1755090600],
    "indicators": {
      "<key>": {
        "raw": [64000.0],
        "normalized": [0.62],
        "state_label": ["LIVE"],
        "values": { "<sub>": [64050.0] }
      }
    }
  },
  "clusters": { ... },
  "volume_profiles": { ... },
  "liquidity_flows": { ... }
}
```

- Candle `time` is epoch **milliseconds**; all OHLCV fields are strings. `reconstructed` is omitted when the candle is live-sourced; when present it is the `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` `ReconstructionMethod` wire value (`EXCHANGE_HISTORICAL`, `EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE`, `LINEAR_INTERPOLATION`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `SYNTHETIC`).
- `indicator_history.times` is epoch **seconds** and is axis-aligned with every inner array: `times[i]` pairs with `raw[i]` / `normalized[i]` / `state_label[i]` / each `values["<sub>"][i]` (AUDIT-V8-006).
- **WARMING placeholders are filtered server-side.** Registry-gate placeholder rows carry `state_label == "WARMING"` with a `raw` value of `0.0`; the history handler never surfaces those — every array slot at such a timestamp is emitted as `null` (and gap-fill Doji bars without indicator data also produce `null` slots), so charts never paint a phantom `0.0` plateau.
- `clusters`, `volume_profiles`, and `liquidity_flows` are per-timeframe-slot maps keyed by the fixed slot names (`micro1`/`micro2`/`fast1`/`fast2`/`slow1`/`slow2`/`macro1`/`macro2`/`longterm1`/`longterm2`); each is omitted when empty.
| `GET` | `/api/monitor` | `symbol` | Multi-TF meta-intelligence (per-TF regime, MTF agreement matrix, MarketContext). |
| `GET` | `/api/connection-quality` | `instance_id` (optional), `timeframe_secs` (optional), `window=one_hour\|six_hour\|twenty_four_hour` (default `one_hour`) | `ConnectionQualityReport` JSON (`window`, `window_start_ms`, `window_end_ms`, `uptime_pct`, `disconnect_count`, `avg_reconnect_ms`, `total_data_loss_secs`, `reconstructed_candles`, `score`). When both `instance_id` and `timeframe_secs` are supplied, returns the per-scope report for that `(instance_id, timeframe_secs)` pair. When either is absent, falls through to a cross-scope process-wide aggregate. See [`08-05-connection-quality.md §REST API`](../operations-and-compliance/08-05-connection-quality.md) for the full schema and behaviour. |

### 2.4 Instances (Workspaces)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/instances?pair_key=` | List running instance summaries. Each summary (InstanceSummary) carries `active_secs: number[]` (v11.2) — the instance's ACTIVE ladder durations, fastest → slowest (the fastest `[workspace].active_timeframes` entries of `FIXED_TF_LADDER`). |
| `POST` | `/api/instances` | Create instance — request body `{ base: string, quote: string, ... }` (exchange + base/quote symbol parts; the UI sends `{ base, quote }`; a bare `{ symbol }` body is rejected `400/422`). |
| `GET` | `/api/instances/:instance_id` | Instance detail (equity, caution). |
| `DELETE` | `/api/instances/:instance_id` | Delete instance. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/instances/by-pair/:pair_key` | Delete by pair key. |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/config` | Reconfigure (`InstanceConfigPayload`) → recharge pipeline. |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/reload` | **Served (v7.1):** tear down + rebuild a single TF pipeline (`slot=micro1|micro2|fast1|fast2|slow1|slow2|macro1|macro2|longterm1|longterm2`) or every ACTIVE slot (`slot=all` — a full recharge rebuilds exactly the fastest-N ACTIVE pipelines, v11.2). See [08-08 CB-11](../operations-and-compliance/08-08-candle-buffer-spec.md) and [03-01-06 DCP-09](../engines/data-infrastructure-engine/03-01-06-die-candle-pipeline-states.md). |
| `GET` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/activation` | **Served (v7.1):** the effective activation set (global `[activation]` ∪ instance `[instances."<id>".activation]`) at the current `config_version` — `{ disabled_indicators, disabled_signals, disabled_signal_kinds, liquidity, config_version }` (AUDIT-V6-212). |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/start` | Transition STOPPED / instance PAUSED → RUNNING (executor admits entries); full lifecycle semantics per [03-03-06](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-06-tae-instance-lifecycle-spec.md). |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/pause` | Pending entries cancelled; open positions still managed (TP/SL/invalidation remain armed); no new setups. See [03-03-06 §3](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-06-tae-instance-lifecycle-spec.md). |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/stop` | Transition RUNNING/lifecycle PAUSED → STOPPING → STOPPED (flatten: cancel orders + market-close positions with `is_emergency_liquidation = true`, `reduce_only = true`). DELETE on a non-STOPPED instance returns `409` (see [03-03-06 IL-08](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-06-tae-instance-lifecycle-spec.md)). |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/safety/reset` | Reset the per-symbol `consecutive_losses` counter (clears `consecutive_losses[sym]`; does **not** release a drawdown or systemic veto — see `/safety/release-veto` below). |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/safety/release-veto` | **Informational safety reset (v7).** Returns the safety state to `NORMAL` (only when the underlying drawdown condition has cleared) + optional peak-equity reset. Returns `422` if the drawdown condition is still active. Distinct from `/safety/reset` (consecutive-loss counters). `operator_id = "local"` is recorded in the resulting `risk_control_events` row. |
| `GET` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/automation` | **v7 TAE surface (served).** Full setup-executor state: mode (paper/live), phase, tracked setup + projected risk/return, entry + bracket orders, position, invalidation state, activity log, safety gate, lifecycle, equity. See [03-03-01 §8.1](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-01-tae-overview-spec.md). |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/automation/close` | **v7 manual override (served).** Cancels pending/bracket orders and closes the open position at market. `exit_reason = "manual"`. |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/mode` | **Removed in v7.2 (was v7.1 served):** execution mode is **fixed at launch**; switching a running instance is no longer supported. Create the instance with the correct `execution_mode` (`observe` | `paper` | `live`) or delete and recreate. Use `POST /api/instances/:instance_id/lifecycle` (`start`/`pause`/`stop`) to control the unified lifecycle (`RUNNING` / lifecycle `PAUSED` / `STOPPING` / `STOPPED` → display `ACTIVE`/`FLATTENING`/`TERMINATED`). |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/intervals` | Set trigger loop intervals (`{ slow_seconds, normal_seconds, fast_seconds }`). |
| `GET` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/portfolio` | **PME v7 (served): rich informational portfolio state** — equity, realized/unrealized/daily PnL, peak + max drawdown %, safety state + context, systemic risk, exposure block (gross/net/long/short/concentration), capital block (available/committed margin, usage, leverage, alert), positions with mark-to-market, lifecycle. Read-only. See [03-04-01 §5](../engines/portfolio-management-engine/03-04-01-pme-overview-spec.md). |
| `GET` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/exposure` | **PME v7 (served):** Exposure Matrix (gross/net/long/short, per-symbol concentration, max single-pair). Read-only. |
| `GET` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/capital` | **PME v7 (served):** Capital Matrix (available/committed margin, margin-usage + leverage ratios, alerts). Read-only. |
| `GET` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/safety` | PME Safety state (v7 extended: adds `max_drawdown_pct`, `daily_pnl`, `margin_usage_ratio`). |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:instance_id/safety/session-reset` | **PME v7 (served, informational):** rebaseline peak equity + daily PnL to current equity (`session_reset`). |

### 2.5 Risk Profiles

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/risk-profiles` | List risk profiles. |
| `POST` | `/api/risk-profiles` | Create (`{ profile_name, capital, max_risk_pct, leverage, commission_pct, funding_rate_8h, spread }`). `funding_rate_8h` is nullable: `null` inherits the global config value; the string `"0"` disables funding accrual; a non-zero string sets an explicit per-profile override. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/risk-profiles/:id` | Delete. |
| `POST` | `/api/risk-profiles/:id` | Update fields with the same nullable `funding_rate_8h` semantics. |

### 2.6 Risk Calculation & Commission

| Method | Path | Request | Response |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| `POST` | `/api/risk/calculate` | `RiskCalculationInput` (see schema below) | `RiskCalculation` (see schema below) |
| `GET` | `/api/risk/fee-table` | `order_type`, `capitals[]`, `leverages[]` | Fee table. |

| `commission_pct` | `Decimal` (string) | yes | Commission as a raw percentage float (e.g. `0.06` = 0.06%). |
| `funding_rate_8h` | `Decimal` (string) or `null` | yes | 8-hour funding rate as a raw percentage float. `null` inherits the global config value; the string `"0"` disables funding. |

| `hold_hours` | `Decimal` (string) | no | Anticipated position hold time (default `8`). Used for funding accrual projection. |

### 2.7 Trades & Journal

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/trades` | Last 100 user trades. |
| `POST` | `/api/trades` | Create trade (`{ symbol, direction, outcome, risk_multiplier, reward_multiplier }`). |
| `GET` | `/api/trade-ledger?limit=` | Telemetry history. |
| `GET` | `/api/trade-journal?limit=` | Journal entries (JOINed). |
| `POST` | `/api/trade-journal/:id/notes` | Update journal (`{ human_notes, execution_score }`). |
| `GET` | `/api/trade-journal/export/csv` | CSV export (1000 records). All per-trade metrics use `roi_pct` (the canonical field; the legacy export alias is deprecated — removal tracked as AUDIT-V4-044, target Unscheduled; retired name recorded in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`). |
| `GET` | `/api/trade-journal/export/json` | JSON export (1000 records). Same canonical `roi_pct` field. |
| `POST` | `/api/trades/telemetry` | Create telemetry history entry. |

### 2.8 Dashboard & System

| Method | Path | Response |
|--------|------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/dashboard/stats?initial_capital=` | `DashboardStats` (20+ stat categories). |
| `GET` | `/api/system/status` | `{ observation_loop_latency_ms, ingest_skew_ms, system_heartbeat_latency_ms, journal_mode, active_pairs_count }`. The three `*_latency_ms` / `*_skew_ms` fields are distinct: `observation_loop_latency_ms` is the end-to-end raw-frame-to-broadcast latency (DIE performance target, see [03-01-01 §3](../engines/data-infrastructure-engine/03-01-01-die-overview-spec.md) and [03-01-03 §5](../engines/data-infrastructure-engine/03-01-03-die-layer2-market-data.md)); `ingest_skew_ms` is the difference between local receipt time and `timestamp_ms` (per-trade skew); `system_heartbeat_latency_ms` is the round-trip of the most recent WS control frame. |
| `GET` | `/api/system/observability?symbol=` | `{ recent_decisions[], completed_trades[] }`. |
| `GET` | `/api/overview` | `OverviewMatrix` — the L7 global synthesis (`global_market_bias`, `market_breadth`, `breadth_pct`, `low_coverage`, `regime_distribution`, `opportunity_distribution`, `risk_distribution` + `risk_environment`, `cascade_risk_index`, `systemic_risk_score`, `asset_ranking`, `market_synchronization`, `market_health`, `alignment_distribution` / `alignment_consensus_index` / `multi_tf_agreement_pct`, `global_summary`, `instance_count`, `active_symbols`). Polled by the dashboard every 3 s; schema: [02-09-overview-matrix.md §2](../matrices/02-09-overview-matrix.md). |
| `GET` | `/api/liquidity/cluster-status?symbol=&slot=` | Per-TF `LiquidationClusterMatrix` refresh status (`ClusterStatusSnapshot`: `{ symbol, timeframe_slot, status, reason?, generated_at_ms?, valid_until_ms?, cluster? }` with status `Pending` while the refresh task has not produced a matrix, `Skipped` + reason when the per-TF kill switch or `[activation] cluster_estimation` disables it, `Ready` otherwise). Response shape adapts to the query: `?symbol=&slot=` → flat single snapshot; `?symbol=` → `{ symbol, slots: { micro1|micro2|fast1|fast2|slow1|slow2|macro1|macro2|longterm1|longterm2: snapshot } }`; no filter → `[{ symbol, slots }]`. |

### 2.8.1 Snapshot Export (v6.10.4+)

The periodic JSON dump scheduler — see
[`../operations-and-compliance/08-09-snapshot-export.md`](../operations-and-compliance/08-09-snapshot-export.md)
for the operator manual and
[`06-03-snapshot-export-schema.md`](06-03-snapshot-export-schema.md) for the on-disk schema.

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/snapshot-export/status` | — | `SnapshotExportRuntime { enabled, output_path, interval_secs, max_snapshots_retained, tabs[], last_snapshot_at, total_snapshots_written, last_error, last_instance_count }`. |
| `PUT` | `/api/snapshot-export/config` | `SnapshotExportConfigPatch` (every field optional): `{ enabled?: bool, output_path?: string, interval_secs?: u64, max_snapshots_retained?: u32, tabs?: string[] }` | Updated `SnapshotExportRuntime`. Validation: `output_path` non-empty (otherwise 400); `interval_secs` clamped to `[5, 3600]`; `max_snapshots_retained` clamped to `[10, 100000]`; unknown `tabs` IDs silently dropped; empty `tabs` list falls back to all 9 canonical ids. |
| `POST` | `/api/snapshot-export/run-now` | — | `{ triggered: true, path: string, note: "Tick scheduled; …" }`. Fires an immediate tick (the next scheduled tick proceeds as usual). |



### 2.10 Exchange Keys (encrypted credentials) — served (v7.1)

Credential management for live trading. All handlers are **registered**. `api_secret` / `passphrase` are stored AES-256-GCM encrypted with `EXCHANGE_SECRET_KEY` (set the env var at daemon start; plaintext storage is refused with `503`). Credentials must be entered through this API (or the Settings UI), **never** in `config.toml`. The encryption contract is in [`06-02-database-schema-spec.md §3.5`](06-02-database-schema-spec.md).

| Method | Path | Request | Response |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| `POST` | `/api/keys` | `{ exchange: "Hyperliquid"\|"Bitget", account_name, api_key, api_secret, passphrase?, referred_uid?, is_active? }` | `201 Created` (body never echoed; secrets encrypted at rest). **Field guide:** Hyperliquid → `api_key` = wallet address (`0x…`), `api_secret` = private key hex; Bitget → `api_key`/`api_secret`/`passphrase` (Bitget passphrase required). |
| `GET` | `/api/keys?exchange=` | — | `{ keys: [{ id, exchange, account_name, is_active, referred_uid, last_sync_timestamp }] }` — secrets never returned. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/keys/:key_id` | — | Deleted. |
| `POST` | `/api/keys/rotate` | `{ new_master_secret: string }` | Decrypts all stored secrets with the current master key, installs the new one in-process, re-encrypts every row (AUDIT-V6-077). |
| `GET` | `/api/keys/backup?passphrase=` | — | Passphrase-keyed AES-256-GCM export of all credentials (`api_secret_encrypted`) for offline storage. |

### 2.11 System diagnostics endpoints

Served since v6.4.1 (previously tracked as the Phase-3 handlers under AUDIT-V6-301; see `docs/CHANGELOG.md`):

| Method | Path | Response |
|--------|------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/system/clock` | `ClockStatusResponse` — `{ within_threshold, drift_us?, jitter_rms_us?, last_poll_ms?, breach_count, breach_action, ntp_servers, sample_count, threshold_micros }` (`crates/api-gateway/src/handlers/clock.rs`). Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when the clock monitor is disabled. `breach_count` is a running `AtomicU32` counter incremented on each observed breach since process start. |
| `GET` | `/api/exchange-status` | Per-exchange connectivity status (`crates/api-gateway/src/handlers/exchange_status.rs`). |
| `GET` | `/api/data-quality` | `PipelineReliabilityMetrics` — `{ coverage, gap_count, outliers_rejected, outliers_bypassed, out_of_order_dropped, total_candles_processed, reconstructed_candles, source_mix }` where `source_mix` has `{ db_warm, rest_gap, live }` (`crates/api-gateway/src/handlers/data_quality.rs`; contract in [03-01-04 §5](../engines/data-infrastructure-engine/03-01-04-die-layer3-data-quality.md)). Aggregates process-wide across all instances. |

### 2.11.1 Platform & DIE system endpoints (v7.3)

| Method | Path | Response |
|--------|------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/system/platform-config` | The serialized `PlatformConfig` from `config.toml` — `{ hyperliquid, bitget, clock_monitor?, quality?, reconnect, candle_buffer, snapshot_export }`. DIE Settings renders these real values (`crates/api-gateway/src/handlers/system.rs`). |
| `GET` | `/api/system/pipelines` | `{ pipelines: [{ pair, slot, timeframe_secs, pipeline_state, buffer_depth, buffer_size, last_completed_close, last_completed_ts, reconstructed_candles }] }` — per-instance × slot candle-pipeline state (DIE L2 Market Data tab). |
| `GET` | `/api/system/distribution` | `{ observation_loop_latency_ms, ingest_skew_ms, system_heartbeat_latency_ms, ws_clients_connected }` — DIE L4 egress telemetry (latency snapshot + live WS client count). |
| `GET` | `/api/connection-quality` | Connection quality report(s) — process-wide aggregate or per-scope when `instance_id` + `timeframe_secs` are supplied; `window=one_hour\|six_hour\|twenty_four_hour`. |

### 2.12 Planned endpoints (not yet served)

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/account/summary` | **v9 Planned.** Aggregated account state: `portfolio_capital_source` (`paper_config \| exchange \| none`), value, equity, realized/unrealized, daily PnL, drawdown, peak, margin usage, safety state, instance + open-position counts. |
| `POST` | `/api/account/capital` | **v9 Planned (paper only; 400 in observe/live).** `{ portfolio_capital_usd }` → session default for new sessions; existing ledgers never silently reseeded. |
| `POST` | `/api/account/reset` | **v9 Planned (paper only).** Reseed the ledger to the configured capital (audit event). |
| `GET` | `/api/strategies` | **v9 Planned.** List strategies (name, base, description, schema_version). |
| `POST` | `/api/strategies` | **v9 Planned.** Create/update a strategy JSON (schema_version + M8 validation + coherence warnings). |
| `PUT` | `/api/strategies/:name` | **v9 Planned.** Update a strategy JSON. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/strategies/:name` | **v9 Planned.** Delete a strategy (blocked when bound to instances; `default` is locked). |
| `POST` | `/api/strategies/:name/clone` | **v9 Planned.** Clone a strategy under a new name. |
| `POST` | `/api/instances/:id/lifecycle` | **v9 Planned.** `{ action: "start" \| "pause" \| "terminate" }` — start → RUNNING; pause → **instance PAUSED** (close-only: no new entries, pending orders cancelled, open positions managed normally); terminate → STOPPED (cancel all orders, force-close at market, `exit_reason = "terminated"`). |

### 2.13 Performance Analytics endpoints (live)

The Performance Analytics Engine exposes serving endpoints under `/api/analytics/*` and `/api/backtest/*`. These are **live** and consumed by the `PerformanceDashboard` Overview / Strategy / Risk Metrics / Regime Map / Trade Analytics / Backtesting panels.

| Method | Path | Response |
|--------|------|----------|
| `GET` | `/api/analytics/summary` | `{ total_trades, total_pnl, win_rate, ... }` aggregate analytics summary. |
| `GET` | `/api/analytics/strategy` | `StrategyAnalyticsRow[]` — per-setup-type NHST (T-Stat, P-Value, P_MC, α = 0.05, edge classification). |
| `GET` | `/api/analytics/risk` | `RiskAnalyticsRow` — Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Ulcer, VaR, ES, max drawdown. |
| `GET` | `/api/analytics/performance` | `PerformanceMatrixRow[]` — regime-strategy performance map. |
| `GET` | `/api/analytics/optimization` | `OptimizationReport` — per-regime performance + recommendations. |
| `GET` | `/api/analytics/strategy/history?limit=` | `StrategyAnalyticsRow[]` — historical strategy analytics. |
| `GET` | `/api/analytics/trades?limit=200` | `TradeAnalyticsRecord[]` — reconstructed closed trades (default limit 200). |
| `GET` | `/api/analytics` | Catch-all for `/api/analytics/*` references — **not registered** (returns 404; only the concrete `/api/analytics/*` rows above are served). |
| `POST` | `/api/backtest/run` | Start a backtest — **v8.2 async**: returns `{ run_id, status: "running" }` immediately. Payload, two forms: standalone `{ exchange, symbols: [{ symbol, timeframes: [60, 180, 300, 900, 3600], allocation_pct }], initial_capital, from_ms, to_ms, mode? }` (no running instance required; `timeframes` = 1..=10 strictly-ascending archive-eligible values ≥ 60 s — the sub-minute fixed slots are live-only — default `[60, 180, 300, 900, 3600]`; Σ allocations ≤ 100 % enforced; Hyperliquid depth validated against the 5,000-candle ceiling per TF) or bound `{ symbol, timeframe_secs, from_ms, to_ms, initial_capital, instance_id?, mode? }` (v8 backward compat; **v11.2** — a bound run replays the bound instance's ACTIVE ladder ∩ ≥ 60 s, i.e. `active_secs` filtered to the archive floor; if that set is empty — the default `active_timeframes = 5` is all sub-minute — the run is rejected `400 no_active_ladder` with a "raise `[workspace].active_timeframes` past the 60 s slots to backtest" message, and a `timeframe_secs` outside the resolved set is rejected `400` naming the set). `mode` is `recorded` (replays recorded MME decisions through the setup executor, paper only) or `historical` (full MME pipeline over the candle archive, multi-symbol). ms→seconds conversion server-side; `400 not_enough_data` with coverage numbers; `400` ceiling/Σ violations naming the limiting TF; global run lock → `409 backtest_busy`. See [BTE overview](../engines/backtesting-engine/08-01-bte-overview.md). The significance treatment (α, Monte Carlo runs, min trades) comes from `[workspace.analytics]`. |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/progress/:run_id` | **v8.2** — live run progress `{ run_id, status, phase: "fetching"|"warming"|"replaying"|"analyzing", pct, message }` (404 when unknown). |
| `POST` | `/api/backtest/cancel/:run_id` | **v8.2** — cancel a running backtest (best-effort; clean abort, no partial persistence). |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/:id` | Fetch a persisted backtest run (or 404). |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/list?limit=N` | Recent persisted runs, newest first — `[{ id, created_at, instance_id, mode, params, summary }]` (History tab). |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/coverage?instance_id=` or `?symbol=&exchange=` | Extended coverage (v8.2) — `{ archive_depth_days, burn_in_secs, ladder, snapshots[], archive[], backfill_jobs[] }`: recorded-snapshot coverage + candle-archive coverage (counts, earliest/latest seconds, covered span, max lookback, coverage %) per symbol × TF, with the per-exchange max-depth ceiling. |
| `POST` | `/api/backtest/archive/backfill` | Start an on-demand archive backfill — bound `{ instance_id, depth_days? }` (v8 compat; instance must be running) or **standalone `{ exchange, symbol, timeframes[], depth_days }`** (v8.2; no instance required; 409 while another job runs for the same `exchange:symbol`) → `{ job_id, depth_days }`. |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/archive/progress/:id` | Live backfill progress — `{ status, pages_fetched, candles_stored, cursor_ts_secs, error, ... }`. |
| `POST` | `/api/backtest/archive/cancel/:id` | Cancel a running backfill (best-effort). |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/:id/trades` | Normalized trade rows for a run (data-science tables). |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/:id/equity` | Normalized equity curve rows for a run. |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/:id/portfolio` | Capital/exposure/drawdown samples for a run. |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/:id/signals` | Per-tick decision snapshots for a run. |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest/:id/metrics` | Summary + NHST key/values for a run. |
| `GET` | `/api/backtest` | Catch-all for `/api/backtest/*` references — **not registered** (returns 404; only the concrete rows above are served). |

The endpoints above are documented in segment form (not in the canonical `(METHOD, /path)` row layout) for readability. Each path is canonical to the per-tab `PerformanceDashboard` `fetch()` call and the `api-gateway` HTTP handler in `crates/api-gateway/src/handlers/analytics.rs`.

## 3. WebSocket Protocol

### 3.1 Endpoint

```
GET /ws?symbol=<PAIR-KEY>&timeframe_secs=<SECONDS>
```

Defaults: symbol = first configured symbol; timeframe_secs = 60.

### 3.2 Frame Format — JSON-RPC 2.0 Notification

Every server→client frame:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "broadcast.market_snapshot",
  "params": {
    "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
    "timeframe_slot": "micro1",
    "timeframe_secs": 60,
    "snapshot": { /* MarketSnapshot — byte-for-byte per 02-07-metrics-matrix.md §2.1 */ }
  }
}
```

`params.timeframe_slot` is the authoritative wire-side slot identifier (`micro1` … `longterm2`, snake_case) — every notification carries it so clients never have to re-derive the slot from `timeframe_secs`. New connections may also select their slot explicitly via `?slot=micro1|micro2|fast1|fast2|slow1|slow2|macro1|macro2|longterm1|longterm2`; legacy clients omit it and the server derives a best-effort slot from the requested duration. Only ACTIVE slots emit frames (v11.2 — the slot enum keeps all 10 identifiers; `[workspace].active_timeframes` governs which slots have pipelines).

The `snapshot` field is the serialized `MarketSnapshot` schema defined in [`02-07-metrics-matrix.md §2.1`](../matrices/02-07-metrics-matrix.md) — fields per 02-07 §2.1 (MANIFEST gate G13). Both `is_completed = true` completed snapshots and `is_completed = false` shadow snapshots ride the same channel; shadow snapshots are display-only and never enter the L4/L5/L6 synthesis cascade.

Key properties:
- No `id` field (notification — no response expected).
- Client send-to-server is not used — **write-only push** from engine.
- The frontend maintains **N parallel connections per instance** — one per ACTIVE ladder slot (N = `[workspace].active_timeframes`, 1..=10, default 5; v11.2 — inactive slots open no socket and emit no frames).
- Exponential backoff on disconnect: initial 1 s → max 30 s; jitter is applied **before** the cap (effective range `[0.8 × delay_n, min(1.2 × delay_n, 30 s)]`). See [`08-03-connection-resilience.md §Backoff Formula`](../operations-and-compliance/08-03-connection-resilience.md).
- `applySnapshotToTimeframe()` parses the nested `snapshot` object and writes to the Svelte 5 rune store.

> **Producer attribution.** The `MarketSnapshot` frames streamed over this WebSocket are produced by **MME Layer 1** (the Metrics Layer), not by DIE L4. MME L1 is the sole producer of `MarketSnapshot` content; DIE L4 owns only the upstream `NormalizedCandle` transport channel. See [03-02-02-mme-layer1-metrics.md §8](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-02-mme-layer1-metrics.md) for the channel specification and [03-01-05-die-layer4-data-distribution.md](../engines/data-infrastructure-engine/03-01-05-die-layer4-data-distribution.md) for the DIE L4 `NormalizedCandle` channel.

### 3.3 JSON-RPC 2.0 method names

The shared crate (`crates/core-domain/src/jsonrpc_methods.rs`) defines JSON-RPC method constants for inter-engine RPC. The single canonical method used by the engine today is the **`broadcast.market_snapshot`** notification (server→client, §3.2 — the frame every `/ws` connection receives, one per `(symbol, timeframe_slot)` subscription). Internal request/response methods (`execution.open_position`, `safety.check`, `config.update`, `config.query`) round-trip via the same RPC envelope but are only used by paired-server flows; clients should only consume `broadcast.market_snapshot` and the documented REST surface.

The `operator_id` field on internal `execution.*` and `safety.*` control frames carries the single-operator identity (see §1) — always `"local"`. There is no caller-supplied identity.

---

## 4. Serialization Conventions

| Rule | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Decimal-as-number | All price/size `Decimal` fields serialize as plain JSON numbers via `rust_decimal`'s `serde-float` feature (`crates/core-domain/Cargo.toml`). Standard JSON parsers materialize them as IEEE-754 doubles; consumers requiring exact decimal semantics must re-parse the raw number literal with a decimal type (see [06-00 §3.2](06-00-consumer-onboarding.md)). |
| Nullable omission | Many `Option` fields serialize as JSON `null` — only fields carrying `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` (or `HashMap::is_empty` for map fields) are omitted from the wire. Annotated examples: `clusters` / `volume_profiles` / `liquidity_flows` on `/api/history`, `MarketSnapshot` fields behind the `skip_serializing_if` gate. Unannotated `Option`s appear explicitly as `null`. |
| Liquidity `Vec<LiquiditySignal>` | Omitted via `skip_serializing_if = "Vec::is_empty"` when no signals fired (never serialized as `[]`). |
| Empty collection omission | Other empty arrays/maps omitted (non-liquidity). |
| Enum casing | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (`BULLISH`, `OVERBOUGHT`, `STRONG_BULL_MTF`). |
| Timestamps | `u64` Unix epoch (seconds or ms, field-dependent). |

---

## 5. Fallback Route

`/api/*` routes that do not match any documented endpoint return `404 Not Found` (plain text in the current release — see the §1.1 note; the JSON envelope ships later). Only non-`/api/*` paths fall through to the static-asset SPA handler serving `ui/dist/`. `/favicon.ico` redirects `301` → `/favicon.svg`.

---

## 6. v10 Data-Science endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/sessions` | list persisted sessions (newest first) |
| GET | `/api/sessions/:id/analytics` | session-scoped PAE payloads (counts + stats) |
| GET | `/api/analytics/comparison` | sessions + backtest runs side by side (comparison table) |
| GET | `/api/backtest/:id/input_bars?symbol=&timeframe_secs=` | the exact input candles a run consumed |
| GET | `/api/backtest/:id/trades` | enriched trades — now carries `ts_entry_secs`, `hold_secs`, `mfe_pct`, `mae_pct`, `roi_pct` |
| GET | `/api/session/status` | now carries `session_id` (v10) |
