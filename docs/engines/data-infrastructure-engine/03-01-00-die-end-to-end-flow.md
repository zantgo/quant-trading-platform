# Data Infrastructure Engine — End-to-End Flow

**Version:** 11.8 (2026-09-16) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.
**Status:** Approved
**Engine:** Data Infrastructure Engine (DIE)
**Purpose:** This document is the **single integrated narrative** for the Data Infrastructure Engine. It traces one trade tick from the exchange WebSocket to the dashboard broadcast and SQLite persistence in one diagram + walkthrough. Each layer's detailed contract lives in its dedicated doc; this document only cross-references them.

> **Reading order.** New operators should read this doc first, then drill into the layer-specific docs as needed. Layer docs (03-01-01..05) describe their layer in isolation; this doc shows how the layers compose.

Connection-quality samples are persisted outside the telemetry logger (see §3):

## 2. Layer walkthrough — what happens to one trade

| Step | Layer | Component | Action |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | L1 | Adapter (`hyperliquid::run_for_symbol` / `bitget::run_for_symbol`) | Open WebSocket. Subscribe to `trades` channel for assigned symbols. |
| 2 | L1 | Adapter | Parse trade JSON → `NormalizedTrade { exchange, symbol, price, size, side, timestamp_ms, trade_id }`. |
| 3 | L1 | Adapter | Wrap as `NormalizedEvent::Trade(...)`; send on bounded mpsc. |
| 4 | L2 | `run_event_router` | Fan out the event to the 4 timeframe receivers. |
| 5 | L2 | `CandleGenerator::process_trade` (per-tier) | Update or close the in-progress candle. Return `(Option<completed>, live)`. |
| 6 | L2 | MME analyzer pipeline | On `Some(completed)`, the MME analyzer pipeline builds the `MarketSnapshot` (candle, indicator buffers, alignment, etc.); DIE L2 emits only the `NormalizedCandle`. |
| 7 | L3 | (inline) | Run `assert_validity` on the candle. Attach `CandleQualityEnvelope` with `quality_score`. Increment `out_of_order_dropped` if applicable. |
| 8 | L4 | `NormalizedCandle` broadcast | Publish completed candle on the DIE L4 `NormalizedCandle` channel; consumed by higher-TF Candle Aggregator. |
| 9 | MME L1 | `MarketSnapshot` broadcast | MME builds `MarketSnapshot` (candle, indicator buffers, alignment, etc.) and publishes on the independent `MarketSnapshot` broadcast channel. |
| 10 | — | Telemetry logger | Subscribe to `MarketSnapshot` channel; on `is_completed = true`, write `TelemetryMsg::InsertSnapshot`. |
| 11 | — | WS handler | Subscribe to `MarketSnapshot` channel; forward to `/ws?symbol=…&timeframe_secs=…` subscribers. |
| 12 | MME L2–L7 | MME analyzer pipeline | Subscribe to `MarketSnapshot` channel; produce Alignment/Analysis/Opportunity/Risk/Decision/Overview from the already-computed indicators and signals in the snapshot. |
| 13 | DB | `logger.rs::run_telemetry_logger` | INSERT into `market_snapshots` (WAL mode). |

Latency budget (per `AC-DIE-3`): p95 < 25 ms end-to-end.

## 3. Connection-quality parallel flow

The connection-quality tracking runs alongside the trade flow, not inline:

```
Adapter lifecycle event (Connected / Disconnected / ReconnectCompleted / Heartbeat)
    │
    ▼
ConnectionQualityTracker::record_*       crates/network-adapters/src/connection_quality_tracker.rs
    │  in-memory rolling windows (1h / 6h / 24h)
    ▼
every 60s: run_persistence_loop          crates/network-adapters/src/connection_quality_tracker.rs::run_persistence_loop
    │  INSERT 3 rows per tick into connection_quality_samples
    ▼
SQLite connection_quality_samples        per-(pair_key, timeframe_secs) rows
    │
    ▼
GET /api/connection-quality?instance_id=…&timeframe_secs=…&window=…
    │  api-gateway/src/handlers/connection_quality.rs
    ▼
Svelte runes store → ConnectionQualityPanel.svelte
```

Reconstructed candles (from [08-04-candle-reconstruction.md](../../operations-and-compliance/08-04-candle-reconstruction.md)) increment `reconstructed_candles` on the tracker. Disconnects / reconnects increment the matching counters; the 60s persistence loop collapses them into per-window samples.

---

## 4. Clock-monitor parallel flow

```
ClockMonitor::run_until_cancelled        crates/network-adapters/src/clock_monitor.rs
    │  every 30s (configurable): poll NTP servers
    │  compute offset + RTT
    │  classify: WithinThreshold | BreachThreshold | NetworkError
    ▼
on breach: log + (optional panic)         see 08-06 §Failure Mode
    │  breach counter exposed via /api/system/clock
    ▼
(no direct coupling to candles; see Drift-Breach Consequence)
```

The clock monitor does not affect the trade path directly. Its drift budget (≤ 100 µs) is the contract that the L2 candle-alignment invariant relies on.

---

## 5. What does NOT flow through the DIE

The DIE does not compute indicators, bias, or risk. Those happen in the MME (consuming the L4 broadcast). The DIE's only outputs are:

- `NormalizedEvent` stream (L1 → L2)
- `NormalizedCandle` stream (L2 → L3 → L4 → Candle Aggregator). DIE L4 publishes `NormalizedCandle` frames on its broadcast channel; the Candle Aggregator is the sole subscriber.
- `MarketSnapshot` transport (MME L1 artifact) — the snapshot is **built by the MME analyzer pipeline** (MME L1; see `01-06` §1 and `03-02-02 §8`). DIE does not construct, attach envelopes to, or route the `MarketSnapshot`; that is MME L1's responsibility.
- `PipelineReliabilityMetrics` (per-instance; served via `GET /api/data-quality` — `crates/api-gateway/src/handlers/data_quality.rs`; see [06-01-api-gateway-contract.md §2.11](../../integration-and-api/06-01-api-gateway-contract.md))
- `ConnectionQualityReport` (per-`(pair_key, timeframe_secs)`, exposed via `/api/connection-quality`)

Anything that requires interpretation of the data (indicators, signals, regime, risk, opportunity, decision) is MME's responsibility and is documented in the MME spec files under `docs/engines/market-monitoring-engine/`.
