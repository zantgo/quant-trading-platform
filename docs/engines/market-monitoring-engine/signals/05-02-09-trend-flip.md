# SignalKind: TrendFlip

**Version:** 11.10 (2026-09-17) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.
**Status:** Approved
**Engine:** Market Monitoring Engine (MME)
**Category:** Trend / Regime
**Purpose:** Specification for the `TrendFlip` SignalKind — the event where a directional indicator reverses its trend state, marking a regime reversal.

---

## 1. Definition

A **TrendFlip** fires when a stateful directional indicator switches its regime from bullish to bearish or vice versa. Unlike a [Crossover](05-02-02-crossover.md) of two series, a TrendFlip is a flip of a single indicator's internal directional state.

| Example | Bullish flip | Bearish flip |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Supertrend | band flips below price | band flips above price |
| Parabolic SAR | dots flip below price | dots flip above price |
| Aroon | Aroon-Up dominates | Aroon-Down dominates |
| SMC Structure | bullish CHoCH | bearish CHoCH |

---

## 2. Producing Indicators

Declared by 8 registry entries (canonical alignment with [04-02-00-indicator-index.md](../indicators/04-02-00-indicator-index.md) §Summary):

| Indicator | `TrendFlip` multiplicity |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| `supertrend` | 1 (band-flip-up / band-flip-down) |
| `adx` | 1 (+DI/-DI crossover) |
| `ichimoku` | 1 (Kumo twist — Tenkan-Kijun cross is now classified as `Crossover`) |
| `psar` | 2 (dot-flip above / below price) |
| `obv` | 2 (cross-above / cross-below SMA) |
| `aroon` | 2 (Up dominates, Down dominates) |
| `smc_structure` | 1 (CHoCH) |
| `smc_order_blocks` | 2 (`SMC_OB_BULLISH_MITIGATED`, `SMC_OB_BEARISH_MITIGATED`) |

> **Editorial correction.** A previous revision of this section listed ten producers (`supertrend`, `adx`, `ichimoku`, `macd`, `volume_profile`, `obv`, `psar`, `aroon`, `smc_structure`, `smc_order_blocks`). The `support_resistance` registry entry was mistakenly added — `support_resistance` emits `Breakout` signals (see [04-02-32-support-resistance.md §6](../indicators/04-02-32-support-resistance.md) and [05-02-04-breakout.md §2](../signals/05-02-04-breakout.md)), not `TrendFlip`. Likewise `macd` and `volume_profile` do not emit `TrendFlip` per the registry. The canonical 8 above are authoritative.

## 3. Detection Semantics

```
prev_direction = PreviousBarState directional state
curr_direction = current directional state
IF prev_direction != curr_direction → TrendFlip
```

TrendFlips are confirmed on **candle close** only — intrabar flips do not enter completed snapshots, preventing whipsaw noise. A Change-of-Character (CHoCH) from the SMC structure indicator is a structural TrendFlip signalling institutional reversal.

---

## 4. Confirmation

`Confirmed` on the close of the flipping bar; the new trend persists as `Active` with `age_bars` counting bars since the flip. A young TrendFlip is a high-priority reversal alert; an aged one is trend context.

---

## 5. Evaluation-Axis Projection

| Axis | Value |
|------|-------|
| Signal Type | `TrendFlip` (via `label`, e.g. `SUPERTREND_FLIP_BULL`). |
| Direction | Bullish / Bearish. |
| Confirmation | Confirmed on close. |
| Freshness | Fresh on the flip bar; ages thereafter. |
| Priority | Critical when fresh. |
