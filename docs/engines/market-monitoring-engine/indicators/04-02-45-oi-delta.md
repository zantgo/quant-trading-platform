# OI Delta (1-Hour Rolling)

**Version:** 11.8 (2026-09-16) — see docs/CHANGELOG.md for the canonical version history.


## Fundamental Mechanism

OI Delta measures the **rate of change** of Open Interest over a rolling window (default 1 hour). Unlike raw OI (a static level), OI Delta captures the *direction and velocity* of capital flow — the first derivative of open interest.

Computed from the `OpenInterest` tracker (`crates/market-analyzer/src/indicators/open_interest.rs`):

```
delta = current_oi - oi_1hour_ago
```

The delta is normalized to `[-1, 1]` via:

$$\text{normalized} = \text{clamp}\left(\frac{\text{delta}}{\text{divisor}},\ -1,\ 1\right)$$

> **Scaling note (v2.1).** The divisor `1000` is **hardcoded** in `normalize_oi_delta` (`crates/market-analyzer/src/indicators/normalized/derivatives.rs`) — it is **not** configurable via `config.toml`. It assumes an asset with OI in the thousands (typical for Hyperliquid/Bitget perpetuals); for assets with OI in the hundreds or tens of thousands, the normalized value will saturate at ±1 or flatline near 0.

## Interpretation

| Delta (relative to divisor) | Label | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| > 0 | `OI_RISING` | Capital flowing in — new positions being established. Confirms trending moves. |
| < 0 | `OI_FALLING` | Capital flowing out — positions closing/liquidating. Signals exhaustion or liquidation cascades. |
| ≈ 0 | `OI_STABLE` | No significant capital-flow signal. |

## Signals

| SignalKind | Label Pattern | Trigger Condition | Direction |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Threshold | OI_SURGE | `delta > +500` — aggressive capital inflow | Purely from the **delta sign**: `Bullish` when `delta > +500`, `Bearish` when `delta < −500` (no trend-context modifier). |
| Threshold | OI_DRAIN | `delta < −500` — aggressive outflow / liquidation | Purely from the **delta sign** (see above). |
| ZeroLineCross | OI_DELTA_ZERO_CROSS | **Strict sign change** versus the previous bar: `(prev_delta ≤ 0 && delta > 0)` or `(prev_delta ≥ 0 && delta < 0)` — a genuine zero-cross, not a ±100 band | Bullish (cross above 0) / Bearish (cross below 0) |

## Normalization

```
normalized = clamp(delta / 1000, -1, 1)        // divisor hardcoded /1000
direction: positive delta → Bullish (>0.1), negative → Bearish (<-0.1), else Neutral
```

## Configuration

`oi_delta_window` — the lookback window in seconds for the 1-hour delta calculation (**documented as configurable; the key is NOT wired** — the runtime hardcodes `OI_DELTA_WINDOW_SECS = 3600` in `analyzer/mod.rs`).
